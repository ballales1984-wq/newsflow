      "content": "<p><em>Welcome back to The State of AI, a new collaboration between the Financial Times and MIT Technology Review. Every Monday, writers from both publications debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution and how it is reshaping global power.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Casey Crownhart, senior reporter for energy at MIT Technology Review and Pilita Clark, FT&#8217;s columnist, consider how China&#8217;s rapid renewables buildout could help it leapfrog on AI progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1127502\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4c1e48f3-a8d9-fed3-bfeb-c686add0bb5d.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Casey Crownhart writes</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the age of AI, the biggest barrier to progress isn’t money <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/data-center-infrastructure-artificial-intelligence.html\">but energy</a>. That should be particularly worrying here in the US, where massive data centers are waiting to come online, and it doesn’t look as if the country will build the steady power supply or infrastructure needed to serve them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t always like this. For about a decade before 2020, data centers were able to offset increased demand <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">with efficiency improvements</a>. Now, though, electricity demand is ticking up in the US, with billions of queries to popular AI models each day—and efficiency gains aren’t keeping pace. With too little new power capacity coming online, the strain is starting to show: Electricity bills are ballooning for people who live in places where data centers place a growing load on the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want AI to have the chance to deliver on big promises without driving electricity prices sky-high for the rest of us, the US needs to learn some lessons from the rest of the world on energy abundance. Just look at China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China installed 429 GW of new power generation capacity in 2024, more than six times the net capacity added in the US during that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China still generates much of its electricity with coal, but that makes up a declining share of the mix. Rather, the country is focused on installing solar, wind, nuclear, and gas at record rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US, meanwhile, is focused on reviving its ailing coal industry. Coal-fired power plants are polluting and, crucially, expensive to run. Aging plants in the US are also less reliable than they used to be, generating electricity just 42% of the time, compared with a 61% capacity factor in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a great situation. And unless the US changes something, we risk becoming consumers as opposed to innovators in both energy and AI tech. Already, China earns more from exporting renewables than the US does from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-05/china-s-clean-energy-exports-are-beating-us-fossil-fuels\">oil and gas exports.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building and permitting new renewable power plants would certainly help, since they’re currently the cheapest and fastest to bring online. But wind and solar are politically unpopular with the current administration. Natural gas is an obvious candidate, though there are concerns about delays with key equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One quick fix would be for data centers to be more flexible. If they agreed not to suck electricity from the grid during times of stress, new AI infrastructure might be able to come online without any new energy infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One study from Duke University found that if data centers agree to curtail their consumption just 0.25% of the time (roughly 22 hours over the course of the year), the grid could provide power for about 76 GW of new demand. That’s like adding about 5% of the entire grid’s capacity without needing to build anything new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But flexibility wouldn’t be enough to truly meet the swell in AI electricity demand. What do you think, Pilita? What would get the US out of these energy constraints? Is there anything else we should be thinking about when it comes to AI and its energy use?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pilita Clark responds:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree. Data centers that can <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/how-were-making-data-centers-more-flexible-to-benefit-power-grids/\">cut</a> their power use at times of grid stress should be the norm, not the exception. Likewise, we need more deals like those <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/2016/11/14/microsoft-announces-largest-wind-energy-purchase-to-date/\">giving</a> cheaper electricity to data centers that let power utilities access their backup generators. Both reduce the need to build more power plants, which makes sense regardless of how much electricity AI ends up using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a critical point for countries across the world, because we still don’t know exactly how much power AI is going to consume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forecasts for what data centers will need in as little as five years’ time <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-data-centres/\">vary wildly</a>, from less than twice today’s rates to four times as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is partly because there’s a lack of public <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z\">data</a> about AI systems’ energy needs. It’s also because we don’t know how much more efficient these systems will become. The US chip designer Nvidia said last year that its specialized chips had become <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ai-energy-efficiency/\">45,000 times</a> more <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-innovation-curb-ais-hunger-for-power-e9c3d8bc\">energy</a> efficient over the previous eight years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, we have been very wrong about tech energy needs before. At the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, it was erroneously <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html\">claimed</a> that the internet would need half the US’s electricity within a decade—necessitating a lot more coal power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, some countries are clearly feeling the pressure already. In Ireland, data centers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f6111a8-0249-4a28-aef4-1854fc8b46f1\">chew up</a> so much power that new connections have been <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1013/1538245-data-centre-policy/\">restricted</a> around Dublin to avoid straining the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some regulators are eyeing new rules forcing tech companies to provide enough power generation to match their demand. I hope such efforts grow. I also hope AI itself helps boost power abundance and, crucially, accelerates the global energy transition needed to combat climate change. OpenAI’s Sam Altman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC-0XqTAeMQ\">said</a> in 2023 that “once we have a really powerful super intelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence so far is not promising, especially in the US, where renewable projects are being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a3cd922-88ed-4188-86ab-ba09fbe24d42\">axed</a>. Still, the US may end up being an outlier in a world where ever cheaper renewables made up <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Mar/Record-Breaking-Annual-Growth-in-Renewable-Power-Capacity#:~:text=With%20585%20GW%20of%20capacity,of%20new%20capacity%20in%202024.\">more than 90%</a> of new power capacity added globally last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Europe is aiming to power one of its <a href=\"https://www.startcampus.pt/\">biggest data centers</a> predominantly with renewables and batteries. But the country leading the green energy expansion is clearly China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 20th century was dominated by countries rich in the fossil fuels whose reign the US now wants to prolong. China, in contrast, may become the world’s first green electrostate. If it does this in a way that helps it win an AI race the US has so far controlled, it will mark a striking chapter in economic, technological, and geopolitical history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Casey Crownhart replies:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I share your skepticism of tech executives’ claims that AI will be a groundbreaking help in the race to address climate change. To be fair, AI is progressing rapidly. But we don’t have time to wait for technologies standing on big claims with nothing to back them up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the grid, for example, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/09/1123404/ai-grid-help/\">experts say</a> there’s potential for AI to help with planning and even operating, but these efforts are still experimental.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, much of the world is making measurable progress on transitioning to newer, greener forms of energy. How that will affect the AI boom remains to be seen. What is clear is that AI is changing our grid and our world, and we need to be clear-eyed about the consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>MIT Technology Review</em> reporters did the math on <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/\">the energy needs of an AI query</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few reasons to be <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/\">optimistic about AI’s energy demands</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>FT</em>’s visual data team take a look<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-data-centres/\">inside the relentless race for AI capacity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And global <em>FT</em> reporters ask whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f6111a8-0249-4a28-aef4-1854fc8b46f1\">data centers can ever truly be green</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>AI and quantum technologies are dramatically reconfiguring how cybersecurity functions, redefining the speed and scale with which digital defenders and their adversaries can operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1127802\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CISCO-iStock-2156608663.jpg\" width=\"1773\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weaponization of AI tools for cyberattacks is already proving a worthy opponent to current defenses. From reconnaissance to ransomware, cybercriminals can automate attacks faster than ever before with AI. This includes using generative AI to create social engineering attacks at scale, churning out tens of thousands of tailored phishing emails in seconds, or accessing widely available voice cloning software capable of bypassing security defenses for as little as a few dollars. And now, agentic AI raises the stakes by introducing autonomous systems that can reason, act, and adapt like human adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But AI isn’t the only force shaping the threat landscape. Quantum computing has the potential to seriously undermine current encryption standards if developed unchecked. Quantum algorithms can solve the mathematical problems underlying most modern cryptography, particularly public-key systems like RSA and Elliptic Curve, widely used for secure online communication, digital signatures, and cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We know quantum is coming. Once it does, it will force a change in how we secure data across everything, including governments, telecoms, and financial systems,” says Peter Bailey, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s security business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most organizations are understandably focused on the immediacy of AI threats,&#8221; says Bailey. “Quantum might sound like science fiction, but those scenarios are coming faster than many realize. It’s critical to start investing now in defenses that can withstand both AI and quantum attacks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical to this defense is a zero trust approach to cybersecurity, which assumes no user or device can be inherently trusted. By enforcing continuous verification, zero trust enables constant monitoring and ensures that any attempts to exploit vulnerabilities are quickly detected and addressed in real time. This approach is technology-agnostic and creates a resilient framework even in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Putting up AI defenses&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is lowering the barrier to entry for cyberattacks, enabling hackers even with limited skills or resources to infiltrate, manipulate, and exploit the slightest digital vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.darktrace.com/blog/survey-findings-ai-cyber-threats-are-a-reality-the-people-are-acting-now\">Nearly three-quarters (74%) of cybersecurity professionals</a> say AI-enabled threats are already having a significant impact on their organization, and 90% anticipate such threats in the next one to two years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“AI-powered adversaries have advanced techniques and operate at machine speed,” says Bailey. “The only way to keep pace is to use AI to automate response and defend at machine speed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, Bailey says, organizations must modernize systems, platforms, and security operations to automate threat detection and response—processes that have previously relied on human rule-writing and reaction times. These systems must adapt dynamically as environments evolve and criminal tactics change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, companies must strengthen the security of their AI models and data to reduce exposure to manipulation from AI-enabled malware. Such risks could include, for instance, prompt injections, where a malicious user crafts a prompt to manipulate an AI model into performing unintended actions, bypassing its original instructions and safeguards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agentic AI further ups the ante, with hackers able to use AI agents to automate attacks and make tactical decisions without constant human oversight. “Agentic AI has the potential to collapse the cost of the kill chain,” says Bailey. “That means everyday cybercriminals could start executing campaigns that today only well-funded espionage operations can afford.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations, in turn, are exploring how AI agents can help them stay ahead. Nearly 40% of companies expect agentic AI to augment or assist teams over the next 12 months, especially in cybersecurity, according to <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/solutions/ai/readiness-index/2025-m10/documents/cisco-ai-readiness-index-2025-realizing-the-value-of-ai.pdf\">Cisco’s 2025 AI Readiness Index</a>. Use cases include AI agents trained on telemetry, which can identify anomalies or signals from machine data too disparate and unstructured to be deciphered by humans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Calculating the quantum threat</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As many cybersecurity teams focus on the very real AI-driven threat, quantum is waiting on the sidelines. Almost three-quarters (73%) of US organizations <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/quantum-and-cybersecurity.html\">surveyed by KPMG</a> say they believe it is only a matter of time before cybercriminals are using quantum to decrypt and disrupt today’s cybersecurity protocols. And yet, the majority (81%) also admit they could do more to ensure that their data remains secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies are right to be concerned. Threat actors are already carrying out <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/q-day-apocalypse-quantum-computers-encryption/\">harvest now, decrypt later attacks</a>, stockpiling sensitive encrypted data to crack once quantum technology matures. Examples include state-sponsored actors intercepting government communications and cybercriminal networks storing encrypted internet traffic or financial records.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large technology companies are among the first to roll out quantum defenses. For example, <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/\">Apple is using cryptography protocol PQ3</a> to defend against harvest now, decrypt later attacks on its iMessage platform. <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/announcing-quantum-safe-digital-signatures-in-cloud-kms\">Google is testing post-quantum cryptography (PQC)</a>—which is resistant to attacks from both quantum and classical computers—in its Chrome browser. And Cisco “has made significant investments in quantum-proofing our software and infrastructure,” says Bailey. “You’ll see more enterprises and governments taking similar steps over the next 18 to 24 months,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulations like the US <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/25/what-the-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-preparedness-act-means-for-national-security/\">Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act</a> lay out requirements for mitigating against quantum threats, including standardized PQC algorithms by the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, a wider range of organizations will start preparing their own quantum defenses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For organizations beginning that journey, Bailey outlines two key actions. First, establish visibility. “Understand what data you have and where it lives,” he says. “Take inventory, assess sensitivity, and review your encryption keys, rotating out any that are weak or outdated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, plan for migration. “Next, assess what it will take to support post-quantum algorithms across your infrastructure. That means addressing not just the technology, but also the process and people implications,” Bailey says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Adopting proactive defense&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the foundation for building resilience against both AI and quantum is a zero trust approach, says Bailey. By embedding zero trust access controls across users, devices, business applications, networks, and clouds, this approach grants only the minimum access required to complete a task and enables continuous monitoring. It can also minimize the attack surface by confining a potential threat to an isolated zone, preventing it from accessing other critical systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into this zero trust architecture, organizations can integrate specific measures to defend against AI and quantum risks. For instance, quantum-immune cryptography and AI-powered analytics and security tools can be used to identify complex attack patterns and automate real-time responses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Zero trust slows down attacks and builds resilience,” Bailey says. “It ensures that even if a breach occurs, the crown jewels stay protected and operations can recover quickly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, companies should not wait for threats to emerge and evolve. They must get ahead now. “This isn’t a what-if scenario; it’s a when,” says Bailey. “Organizations that invest early will be the ones setting the pace, not scrambling to catch up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

Where did it go wrong?<br /><br /></strong>In the 1990s, a six-step methodology for innovation called design thinking started to grow in popularity. Key to its spread was its replicable aesthetic, represented by the Post-it note: a humble square that anyone can use in infinite ways.<br /><br />But in recent years, for a number of reasons, the shine of design thinking has been wearing off. Critics have argued that its short-term focus on novel and naive ideas results in unrealistic and ungrounded recommendations.<br /><br />Today, some groups are working to reform both design thinking’s principles and its methodologies. These new efforts seek a set of design tools capable of equitably serving diverse communities and solving diverse problems well into the future. It’s a much more daunting—and crucial—task than design thinking’s original remit. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/09/1067821/design-thinking-retrospective-what-went-wrong/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Rebecca Ackermann</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>We can still have nice things</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day.

They can take the form of giant circles and squares, cloverleafs and octagons, complex S-curves and simple mounds.<br /><br />Until recently, it seemed as if much of the continent’s pre-European archaeological heritage had been carelessly wiped out, uprooted, and lost for good. But traces remain: electromagnetic remnants in the soil that can be detected using specialty surveying equipment.

      "content": "<div></div>\n\n\n<p>Vanguard feels and smells like a new RV. It has long, gray banquettes that convert into bunks, a microwave cleverly hidden under a counter, a functional steel sink with a French press and crockery above. A weird little toilet hides behind a curtain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some clues hint that you can’t just fire up Vanguard’s engine and roll off the lot. The least subtle is its door, a massive disc of steel complete with a wheel that spins to lock.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Vanguard subsea human habitat from the outside door.\" class=\"wp-image-1127708\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MarkHarris_20251029_171637167.MP_.jpg?w=2363\" width=\"2363\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">COURTESY MARK HARRIS</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Once it is sealed and moved to its permanent home beneath the waves of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary early next year, Vanguard will be <a href=\"https://www.deep.com/vanguard/\">the world’s first new subsea habitat in nearly four decades</a>. Teams of four scientists will live and work on the seabed for a week at a time, entering and leaving the habitat as scuba divers. Their missions could include reef restoration, species surveys, underwater archaeology, or even astronaut training.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Vanguard’s modules, unappetizingly named the “wet porch,” has a permanent opening in the floor (a.k.a. a “moon pool”) that doesn’t flood because Vanguard’s air pressure is matched to the water around it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is this pressurization that makes the habitat so useful. Scuba divers working at its maximum operational depth of 50 meters would typically need to make a lengthy stop on their way back to the surface to avoid decompression sickness. This painful and potentially fatal condition, better known as the bends, develops if divers surface too quickly. A traditional 50-meter dive gives scuba divers only a handful of minutes on the seafloor, and they can make only a couple of such dives a day. With Vanguard’s atmosphere at the same pressure as the water, its aquanauts need to decompress only once, at the end of their stay. They can potentially dive for many hours every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could unlock all kinds of new science and exploration. “More time in the ocean opens a world of possibility, accelerating discoveries, inspiration, solutions,” said Kristen Tertoole, Deep’s chief operating officer, at Vanguard’s unveiling in Miami in October. “The ocean is Earth’s life support system. It regulates our climate, sustains life, and holds mysteries we’ve only begun to explore, but it remains 95% undiscovered.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Vanguard subsea human habitat unveiled in Miami\" class=\"wp-image-1127705\" height=\"1322\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CourtesyDEEP_Vanguard-subsea-human-habitat-unveiled-in-Miami.jpg?w=2144\" width=\"2144\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">COURTESY DEEP</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Subsea habitats are not a new invention. Jacques Cousteau (naturally) built the first in 1962, although it was only about the size of an elevator. Larger habitats followed in the 1970s and ’80s, maxing out at around the size of Vanguard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the technology has come a long way since then. Vanguard uses a tethered connection to a buoy above, known as the “surface expression,” that pipes fresh air and water down to the habitat. It also hosts a diesel generator to power a Starlink internet connection and a tank to hold wastewater. Norman Smith, Deep’s chief technology officer, says the company modeled the most severe hurricanes that Florida expects over the next 20 years and designed the tether to withstand them. Even if the worst happens and the link is broken, Deep says, Vanguard has enough air, water, and energy storage to support its crew for at least 72 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That number came from DNV, an independent classification agency that inspects and certifies all types of marine vessels so that they can get commercial insurance. Vanguard will be the first subsea habitat to get a DNV classification. “That means you have to deal with the rules and all the challenging, frustrating things that come along with it, but it means that on a foundational level, it’s going to be safe,” says Patrick Lahey, founder of Triton Submarines, a manufacturer of classed submersibles.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"An interior view of Vanguard during Life Under The Sea: Ocean Engineering and Technology Company DEEP's unveiling of Vanguard, its pilot subsea human habitat at The Hangar at Regatta Harbour on October 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.\" class=\"wp-image-1127704\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244006535.jpg?w=3000\" width=\"3000\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">JASON KOERNER/GETTY IMAGES FOR DEEP</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Although Deep hopes Vanguard itself will enable decades of useful science, its prime function for the company is to prove out technologies for its planned successor, an advanced modular habitat called <a href=\"https://www.deep.com/sentinel/\">Sentinel</a>. Sentinel modules will be six meters wide, twice the diameter of Vanguard, complete with sweeping staircases and single-occupant cabins. A small deployment might have a crew of eight, about the same as the International Space Station. A big Sentinel system could house 50, up to 225 meters deep. Deep claims that Sentinel will be launched at some point in 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, according to its mission statement, Deep seeks to “make humans aquatic,” an indication that permanent communities are on its long-term road map.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep has not publicly disclosed the identity of its principal funder, but <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15105319/filing-history/MzQ2MTE2NDY2NGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0\">business records in the UK</a> indicate that as of January 31, 2025 a Canadian man, Robert MacGregor, owned at least 75% of its holding company. According to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/bitcoin-wright-patents/\">Reuters investigation</a>, MacGregor was once linked with Craig Steven Wright, a computer scientist who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, as bitcoin’s elusive creator is pseudonymously known. However, Wright’s claims to be Nakamoto later collapsed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacGregor has kept a very low public profile in recent years. When contacted for comment, Deep spokesperson Mike Bohan refused to comment on the link with Wright, only to say it was inaccurate, but said: “Robert MacGregor started his career as an IP lawyer in the dot-com era, moving into blockchain technology and has diverse interests including philanthropy, real estate, and now Deep.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, MacGregor could find keeping that low profile more difficult if Vanguard is successful in reinvigorating ocean science and exploration as the company hopes. The habitat is due to be deployed early next year, following final operational tests at Triton’s facility in Florida. It will welcome its first scientists shortly after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ocean is not just our resource; it is our responsibility,” says Tertoole. “Deep is more than a single habitat. We are building a full-stack capability for human presence in the ocean.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"An interior view of Vanguard during Life Under The Sea: Ocean Engineering and Technology Company DEEP's unveiling of Vanguard, its pilot subsea human habitat at The Hangar at Regatta Harbour on October 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

      "content": "<p>Ci vollero cinque tentativi per impiccare Ken Saro-Wiwa: il nodo continuava a sciogliersi. Al primo fallimento gridò dalla forca: “Perché mi trattate così? Che razza di paese è questo?”. Chi aveva ordinato l’esecuzione, il 10 novembre 1995, credeva che quel cappio avrebbe chiuso una questione. Invece l’ha aperta. Da quel giorno di Saro-Wiwa si è parlato ovunque: nei tribunali, nelle università, nelle manifestazioni.</p>\n<p>Saro-Wiwa, nato nel 1941 a Bori, nel Delta del Niger, era innanzitutto uno scrittore, uno di quelli che credeva – ingenuamente, diranno i cinici – nel potere delle parole di cambiare il mondo. Le sue opere non cercavano gloria intellettuale, erano un modo per schierarsi. <em><a href=\"https://www.baldinicastoldi.it/libri/sozaboy/\">Sozaboy</a></em>, con quel pidgin english rotto e meraviglioso, era un’insurrezione linguistica, prendeva la lingua del colonizzatore e la faceva a pezzi. <em>Basi&amp;Co,</em> la sitcom più popolare nella Nigeria degli anni Ottanta, da lui ideata, con milioni di nigeriani che ridevano delle disavventure di un piccolo truffatore di Lagos, era satira tagliente.</p>\n<p>C’era però una battaglia che le parole da sole non potevano vincere. Quella del suo popolo, gli ogoni, la cui vita scorreva in una terra che moriva. Nel Delta del Niger compagnie petrolifere multinazionali, Shell in testa, estraevano greggio – ma senza le tutele ambientali che rispettavano in Occidente – e insieme al petrolio usciva tutto il resto: acque nere dei gas bruciati a cielo aperto, perdite dai condotti, falde contaminate. Un doppio standard che condannava gli ogoni a pagare il prezzo del petrolio che illuminava le città europee. Lo Stato nigeriano incassava le royalties. Le compagnie straniere ottenevano profitti immensi. E agli ogoni – che allora contavano mezzo milione di persone – restava una quota ufficiale del’1,5% e un paesaggio distrutto. I raccolti si riducevano, i pesci morivano, l’aria diventava irrespirabile.</p>\n<p>Saro-Wiwa lo chiamò “genocidio ambientale”. Uno sterminio non attraverso le armi, ma l’inquinamento e l’abbandono. Una questione non solo ecologica, ma di giustizia. Dalla biblioteca passò alla piazza: organizzò manifestazioni, scrisse appelli, parlò alle conferenze internazionali. Fondò, nel 1990, il Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) e, il 4 gennaio 1993, portò trecentomila persone a marciare pacificamente contro Shell e il governo nigeriano. La risposta fu brutale. Raid militari nei villaggi, arresti arbitrari, torture, esecuzioni sommarie.</p>\n<p>Finché, nel 1994, durante scontri interni alla comunità ogoni, quattro capi tradizionali vennero uccisi. Le circostanze erano oscure e le responsabilità mai chiarite, ma il regime militare di Sani Abacha aveva bisogno di un capro espiatorio. Chi meglio di Saro-Wiwa, il volto noto del movimento? Venne arrestato insieme ad altri otto attivisti del Mosop – gli “Ogoni Nine” –, accusati di essere i mandanti morali degli omicidi. Il processo fu una farsa: testimoni corrotti, difesa ostacolata, verdetto scontato. La comunità internazionale protestò, Nelson Mandela chiese clemenza, le Nazioni Unite minacciarono sanzioni. Tutto inutile. Il 10 novembre 1995 Saro-Wiwa e gli altri otto furono impiccati.</p>\n<p>La notizia scosse il mondo. La Nigeria fu sospesa dal Commonwealth. Shell fu accusata di complicità con il regime militare.</p>\n<p>Ma nel Delta del Niger cosa è cambiato davvero? Trent’anni dopo il bilancio è amaro. Nel 2011, l’Unep ha pubblicato un rapporto devastante sulla contaminazione del territorio ogoni, stimando che la bonifica completa avrebbe richiesto trent’anni e miliardi di dollari. Solo nel 2016 è stato avviato un progetto di bonifica (Hyprep): “Un fallimento totale”, secondo <em>The Independent</em>. Shell, dopo aver pagato diversi risarcimenti, ha operato nell’area fino al 2024, quando ha venduto le sue attività sulla terraferma a un consorzio locale. E nel giugno di quest’anno il presidente nigeriano Bola Tinubu ha concesso la grazia postuma agli Ogoni Nine. “Una grazia suggerisce che sia stato commesso un crimine. Ma quale crimine?”, si è chiesta Noo Saro-Wiwa, figlia di Ken.</p>\n<p>Il messaggio di suo padre era chiaro: <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/lultimo-rapporto-ipcc-giustizia-ambientale-e-giustizia-sociale\">non esiste giustizia sociale senza giustizia ambientale</a>; la lotta ambientale è una lotta per i diritti umani. Parole che hanno attraversato confini, ispirando movimenti ambientalisti dall’Indonesia all’Amazzonia, fino a farsi – altrove – citazioni. Ma citarlo non basta. La memoria da sola non libera. Ricordare Saro-Wiwa oggi non è un esercizio nostalgico o celebrativo. Significa chiedersi: noi, cosa stiamo facendo? Di fronte alle crisi ambientali del nostro tempo, di fronte alle ingiustizie ecologiche che si moltiplicano?</p>\n<p>“La storia è dalla nostra parte”, amava ripetere Saro-Wiwa. Non era ottimismo ingenuo, era fiducia nella capacità degli esseri umani di imparare dai propri errori. A giudicare con gli occhi di oggi, verrebbe da dire che si sbagliava. La sua eredità sopravvive, sì, ma come rimprovero, non come vittoria; per ora la storia non ci assolve. Gli errori del passato continuano a ripetersi, mentre corriamo verso il disastro ecologico con la stessa colpevole indifferenza che ha portato alla devastazione del Delta del Niger.</p>\n<p>Ma la storia non è finita, continua a chiedere risposte. E chissà se lentamente, dolorosamente, il mondo imparerà le lezioni che Saro-Wiwa ha pagato con la vita.</p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: A file picture dated 31 December 2011 shows a man covers his hands in crude oil during a protest against Shell after a oil spill from a Shell oil field in Bonga, Nigeria.

      "content": "<p>A dieci anni dalla firma dell’Accordo di Parigi (2015), la conferenza mondiale sul clima assume nel 2025 una connotazione più che simbolica: si apre a Belém, in Amazzonia, la 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference, meglio nota come Cop30, che rappresenta forse un bivio per la cooperazione internazionale, per la credibilità delle promesse climatiche e per la stessa idea di responsabilità globale.</p>\n<p><!--mitigo-paywall--></p>\n<p>Il luogo scelto, l’Amazzonia, è più di un simbolo – della natura che assorbe carbonio, della biodiversità che resiste, <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/cop-16-tra-luci-e-ombre\">delle comunità indigene</a> che portano memoria e sapienza – ma anche un termometro dell’inerzia globale e delle contraddizioni nella lotta al cambiamento climatico. Che la Cop30 si tenga in questa regione è chiaramente un messaggio politico. Eppure, il contesto politico internazionale non è favorevole. Se l’Accordo di Parigi aveva riacceso le speranze nel 2015, oggi quel fervore appare – almeno in parte – esaurito. Le temperature medie globali hanno accumulato un ritardo rispetto alle ambizioni originarie; gli impegni, ancora fragili; la fiducia reciproca, incrinata. In questo scenario, la Cop30 potrebbe essere un terreno di verifica: la domanda da porsi è se la cooperazione internazionale possa ancora reggere la prova dell’“azione” e della “responsabilità condivisa”.</p>\n<p>Alla vigilia di Belém, emergono almeno tre sfide che rischiano di compromettere il buon esito della conferenza. Il tema della transizione dai combustibili fossili tutt’altro che risolto. La questione della fiducia e del coordinamento internazionale: quando un attore centrale – si pensi agli Stati Uniti – decide di ritirarsi o di ridurre l’impegno, non è solo un gesto simbolico, ma un segnale che altera la logica del “gioco” tra paesi, mettendo a rischio lo scenario cooperativo. E, infine, la dimensione della giustizia climatica: le comunità vulnerabili chiedono risposte concrete, non solo promesse future, dando particolare peso alla just transition (“transizione giusta”). D’altro canto Belém potrebbe rivelarsi una conferenza sui generis: non servono più nuovi target, ma strumenti e pratiche che traducano gli impegni in risultati. <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/action-agenda\">Il documento Action Agenda</a> promosso dalla presidenza brasiliana indica sei assi strategici: energia-industria-trasporti; foreste-oceani-biodiversità; agricoltura-sistemi alimentari; resilienza-città-infrastrutture-acqua; sviluppo sociale-umano; abilitatori e acceleratori (finanza, tecnologia, capacità). Questa articolazione riflette la consapevolezza che la crisi climatica è sistemica e richiede risposte integrate, non segmentate, adesso.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, la rilevanza della Cop30 va oltre la costruzione di una nuova roadmap. Essa sarà la cartina di tornasole della distinzione tra due scenari possibili: l’uno in cui la cooperazione internazionale si rinsalda e produce progressi reali; l’altro in cui il disimpegno, l’inerzia e la frammentazione prevalgono, rendendo le promesse un esercizio formale. In termini matematici, come in un gioco di coordinamento, quando un attore chiave si ritira o sceglie di non cooperare, l’intero sistema può deviare verso un equilibrio sub-ottimale, in cui tutti perdono pur di non rischiare da soli.</p>\n<p>È esattamente ciò che è accaduto con l’Accordo di Parigi. Nato nel 2015 per unire i paesi nella lotta contro il cambiamento climatico e contenere l’aumento della temperatura globale ben al di sotto dei 2° Celsius rispetto ai livelli preindustriali, l’accordo rappresentava un raro momento di convergenza politica. Ma quella fragile architettura multilaterale ha mostrato subito la sua vulnerabilità: la vittoria di Donald Trump e la successiva decisione di ritirare gli Stati Uniti dall’accordo hanno alterato la dinamica di cooperazione, producendo un effetto domino di incertezza e rinvio che ha pesato sugli obiettivi climatici globali. Essendo il secondo maggiore emettitore di gas serra al mondo, l’uscita degli Stati Uniti mina gli sforzi internazionali per ridurre le emissioni e contrastare il cambiamento climatico. L’amministrazione Trump ha dato priorità alla produzione di combustibili fossili e ha smantellato numerose regolamentazioni ambientali, complicando ulteriormente il percorso verso il raggiungimento dei target dell’accordo.</p>\n<p>L’approccio dell’amministrazione Trump alle relazioni internazionali – in particolare il suo impegno in una guerra commerciale con la Cina e l’Unione europea – ha rappresentato un più ampio arretramento dal multilateralismo. Questa attitudine, esemplificata proprio dalla decisione di abbandonare l’Accordo di Parigi, segna un passaggio dal coordinamento internazionale all’unilateralismo. In questo clima politico, la cooperazione non è stata solo accantonata, ma spesso rappresentata come segno di debolezza.</p>\n<p>Eppure, la cooperazione non è soltanto un imperativo morale, ma un elemento fondamentale del progresso – soprattutto quando si tratta di affrontare sfide condivise come quella climatica. In un recente articolo pubblicato su <em>The Conversation</em>, Rebekkah Markey-Towler <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-has-withdrawn-the-us-from-the-paris-agreement-heres-why-thats-not-such-a-bad-thing-248109\">ha sostenuto</a> che l’uscita degli Stati Uniti, piuttosto che compromettere definitivamente la lotta al cambiamento climatico, potrebbe consentire ad altri paesi di agire più liberamente per ridurre le emissioni. Tuttavia, il Global Stocktake del 2023 dell’Unep ha rivelato che gli sforzi attuali restano insufficienti a raggiungere gli obiettivi di lungo termine dell’Accordo di Parigi: le proiezioni indicano un possibile aumento della temperatura compreso tra 2,5 e 2,9°C rispetto ai livelli preindustriali entro la fine del secolo. L’uscita degli Stati Uniti potrebbe quindi non rappresentare affatto una buona notizia, proprio a causa degli effetti di imitazione e retroazione che potrebbe generare.</p>\n<p>E nonostante i maggiori impegni assunti da diversi paesi, il ritmo dei progressi rimane inadeguato. Questi risultati sottolineano l’urgente necessità di una cooperazione globale rafforzata, di politiche più incisive e di obiettivi più ambiziosi. Il ritiro statunitense esercita una crescente pressione sugli altri paesi affinché intensifichino i propri sforzi di mitigazione, alterando l’equilibrio delle responsabilità condivise e complicando l’impresa collettiva di conseguire i traguardi dell’accordo. Per evitare gli effetti più gravi del cambiamento climatico, sono richieste azioni immediate e decisive.</p>\n<p>In un recente <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5181167\">lavoro</a>, insieme a Giorgos Galanis (Queen Mary University of London) e a Ben Tippet (King’s College of London), abbiamo mostrato che le azioni nazionali generano effetti di secondo ordine: una forma di pressione fra i pari (peer pressure). Tali effetti sono intuitivi se si considera l’azione climatica come un gioco di coordinamento. Pensare all’azione climatica in termini di teoria dei giochi è utile perché evidenzia come gli sforzi di un paese dipendano da ciò che fanno gli altri. Immaginiamo, per esempio, un gioco del cervo (Stag Hunt) tra due paesi, A e B. Ognuno può scegliere tra due strategie: adottare politiche climatiche ambiziose (cacciare il cervo) oppure mantenere lo status quo (cacciare il coniglio). Se entrambi scelgono l’azione ambiziosa, ottengono benefici comuni – un ambiente più sano, uno sviluppo sostenibile. Ma se solo uno dei due agisce sostiene costi elevati senza ottenere i benefici completi, mentre l’altro fa il free rider. Se nessuno agisce, entrambi subiscono gli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico. Il gioco presenta quindi due possibili equilibri (di Nash): uno di cooperazione e benessere reciproco, e uno di inerzia e danno condiviso. Nella realtà, però, i paesi affrontano vincoli differenti e possiedono preferenze eterogenee, influenzate da fattori politici ed economici. Queste differenze possono essere considerate come bias (distorsioni) positivi o negativi che condizionano l’evoluzione delle iniziative globali sul clima. Noi crediamo che tener conto di tali bias può modificare in modo sostanziale la traiettoria degli sforzi climatici globali. Attualmente, i livelli di impegno dei vari paesi sono fortemente influenzati dalla partecipazione o meno degli Stati Uniti all’Accordo di Parigi. Se gli Stati Uniti si ritirano, i paesi che non hanno un forte orientamento a favore di misure climatiche potrebbero decidere di non agire. Questo, a sua volta, può innescare una catena di astensioni che ci spinge verso il “cattivo equilibrio” di non-cooperazione. E tale effetto negativo, derivante dal ritiro statunitense, risulta ancora più marcato se si considerano le reti politiche ed economiche internazionali, che amplificano l’influenza politica globale degli Stati Uniti.</p>\n<p>Anche se l’impatto concreto del disimpegno americano sugli indicatori di emissione non è immediatamente visibile, gli effetti politici e simbolici di “pressione tra pari” sono già evidenti. Un sondaggio condotto prima delle elezioni americane da Undp e Università di Oxford in 77 paesi – che rappresentano l’87% della popolazione mondiale – mostrava un ampio sostegno popolare per l’azione contro il cambiamento climatico. Tuttavia, dopo l’avvio della seconda amministrazione Trump, il consenso politico per partiti che minimizzano la questione climatica è in crescita, in particolare in Europa. E data la stretta connessione politica ed economica con gli Stati Uniti, è prevedibile che le politiche americane possano rafforzare il sostegno a posizioni anti-ambientaliste anche altrove. Se già prima il raggiungimento degli obiettivi climatici era difficile, dopo l’allontanamento americano dall’Accordo di Parigi appare quasi improbabile.</p>\n<p>In un mondo in cui le grandi potenze – come gli Stati Uniti – tendono sempre più a privilegiare interessi nazionali di breve periodo, come accaduto durante l’era Trump in campo commerciale e ambientale, lo sforzo collettivo necessario per affrontare la crisi climatica diventa estremamente fragile.</p>\n<p>Nelle democrazie, tuttavia, la pressione tra pari non proviene soltanto dalla comunità internazionale, ma anche dai cittadini che eleggono i propri governi. Rimane quindi la possibilità che i governi presenti e futuri tengano conto delle preferenze popolari per un’azione climatica decisa, rendendo ciò che oggi appare improbabile ancora possibile — una possibilità che poggia, in ultima analisi, sulla forza della cooperazione.</p>\n<p>Alla vigilia della Cop30, la sfida è ricostruire ciò che un decennio di disillusione ha eroso: la fiducia che la cooperazione possa produrre risultati concreti. L’Accordo di Parigi non è in crisi per mancanza di strumenti, ma per deficit di volontà collettiva. Le potenze emergenti, dal Brasile all’India, rivendicano un ruolo più autonomo; gli Stati Uniti oscillano tra impegno e disimpegno; l’Europa, pur dichiarando ambizione, mostra segni di stanchezza politica. Eppure, nel momento in cui il mondo guarda a Belém, resta aperta la possibilità che il Sud globale diventi il nuovo motore di una cooperazione rinnovata, più equa e meno centrata sull’Occidente. Se la Cop30 riuscirà a invertire la logica del sospetto e della competizione, allora l’Accordo di Parigi potrà ancora essere salvato. Perché, come ricorda il biologo Martin Nowak, la cooperazione non è un ideale ingenuo, ma la condizione stessa dell’evoluzione e della sopravvivenza collettiva.</p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: Aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest, near Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Amazon_River#/media/File:Amazon_CIAT_(2).jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Palmer/CIAT | Wikimedia Commons</a></h6>\n<p>L'articolo <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/belem-amazzonia-cop30/\">Apre la Cop30, dieci anni dopo l&#8217;Accordo di Parigi</a> proviene da <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net\">MicroMega</a>.</p>",

Non solo, come ci racconta <strong>Micol Meghnagi</strong>, per motivi ideologici, ma anche per ricompattare un elettorato di destra deluso dalla mancata “sconfitta totale” di Hamas: “<a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/a-gaza-la-tregua-in-cisgiordania-il-via-libera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>A Gaza la tregua, in Cisgiordania il via libera</strong></a>”.</p>\n<p>Rimanendo sulla stessa zona di mondo, <strong>Roberto Rosano</strong> ha intervistato Arturo Marzano, a partire dal suo recente <em>Storia di Gaza</em>, per analizzare le radici della crisi, le metamorfosi del sionismo e il ruolo di Hamas nel futuro della Striscia: “<a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/gaza-una-ribellione-lunga-millenni\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gaza, una ribellione lunga millenni.

Dalle risposte che i dem daranno dipenderà in gran parte la possibilità di contrastare l’onda lunga del populismo trumpiano e la sua messa in crisi della democrazia statunitense.<!--mitigo-paywall--></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">Il primo elemento, quello dell’analisi del voto di martedì, potrebbe assumere forme diverse. È vero, ovviamente, che <a href=\"https://www.transition2025.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">la vittoria di Zohran Mamdani a New York</a> presenta elementi, e un significato storico, che quelle di Mikie Sherrill e Abigail Spanberger, in New Jersey e Virginia, non hanno. Mamdani, con la sua figura e la sua campagna, si è trovato all’incrocio di spinte e tensioni diverse. Tra queste: le politiche autoritarie dell’amministrazione Trump, dalle deportazioni di migranti all’occupazione militare delle città; l’opposizione alla guerra a Gaza, maturata in larghi settori delle popolazioni urbane occidentali, in particolare quelle più giovani; il senso di incertezza e insoddisfazione che l’aumento del costo della vita produce nella working-class e nella borghesia delle città; l’orgoglio, il senso di nuove opportunità che le comunità di immigrati newyorkesi hanno provato nel trovarsi di fronte, come candidato sindaco, un 34enne di recente immigrazione.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">Con una campagna intelligente, con un magistrale uso dei social, con il beneficio di un avversario, Andrew Cuomo, percepito come il volto della vecchia nomenclatura corrotta, Mamdani ha fatto da sintesi a tante cose diverse e trionfato. Se però dovessimo cercare l’elemento più forte e significativo della sua campagna, non potremmo che tornare alla parola scelta come slogan. </span><em><span lang=\"it-IT\">Affordable</span></em><span lang=\"it-IT\">. <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/la-partita-che-zohran-mamdani-ha-gia-vinto\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mamdani ha convinto i newyorkesi a votarlo con la promessa di rendere la città più accessibile</a>. Affitti bloccati, </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">asili e scuole gratuite per i bambini dai sei mesi ai cinque anni, servizi di bus gratuiti, negozi a prezzi calmierati in ognun</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">o dei cinque quartieri cittadini: è attorno a questa promessa di migliore qualità della vita, in una città strozzata da prezzi esorbitanti e servizi discutibili, che si è riunita la coalizione che ha portato Mamdani alla vittoria.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">I programmi che due democratiche moderate come Mikie Sherrill e Abigail Spanberger hanno offerto agli elettori non hanno sicuramente gli elementi di audacia di quello del socialista democratico Mamdani. Ugualmente, anche le due nuove governatrici di New Jersey e Virginia hanno insistito sui cosiddetti </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">bread and butter issues</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">, le questioni legate alla vita di tutti i giorni. “The Affordability Agenda”, l’agenda dell’accessibilità, è il titolo che Sherrill ha dato al suo programma. “Non c’è bisogno che qualcuno vi dica che i costi per tutto, dall’assistenza sanitaria all’alloggio alla spesa, sono troppo alti. E nonostante tutte le promesse dei politici di carriera di fare qualcosa al riguardo, nulla sembra cambiare”, ha affermato in campagna elettorale la nuova governatrice del New Jersey. Quanto ad Abigai Spanberger, durante l’avventura elettorale di questi mesi ha spesso ripetuto di voler parlare “più dei nostri coltivatori di soia che di Trump”, affermando di “battersi per un’economia in cui ogni virginiano possa guadagnarsi da vivere bene, prendersi cura della propria famiglia e sapere che avrà una pensione sicura”.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">In modi diversi, declinando i programmi sulla base delle situazioni locali, Mamdani, Sherrill e Spanberger hanno dunque vinto grazie alle loro proposte economiche. Donald Trump e i repubblicani hanno perso proprio a causa delle promesse economiche mancate. In campagna elettorale, nel 2024, Trump aveva giurato che avrebbe fatto calare i prezzi “dal giorno uno del mio mandato”. Non è stato così. L’inflazione rimane un problema. Il periodo tra luglio e agosto ha visto il più grande balzo in avanti mensile dei prezzi dei generi alimentari negli ultimi tre anni. A settembre i prezzi erano di circa il 2,7% più alti rispetto all’anno precedente. Gli aumenti più significativi riguardano i costi del caffè (+18,9%) e della carne di manzo e vitello (+14,7%). È grazie a questi numeri che i democratici hanno vinto ed è questo che tiene insieme tre avventure politiche così diverse come quelle di Mamdani, Sherrill e Spanberger. È vero che essere all’opposizione, a livello nazionale, ha favorito i dem – nel novembre 2024 fu proprio il controllo del governo a nuocere a Joe Biden. Ed è altrettanto vero che, in un’eventuale elezione nazionale, entrano elementi più generali – politica estera, diritti riproduttivi – meno presenti a livello locale. Ma, in vista delle prossime elezioni di midterm, i democratici devono tenere chiaramente in testa che sono stati programmi ispirati a una migliore qualità della vita, a una maggiore giustizia sociale, a permettergli di vincere il 4 novembre.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">La seconda riflessione che il voto di martedì suggerisce riguarda gli equilibri interni ai democratici. È indubbio che la vittoria di Mamdani trasmetta una serie di scosse telluriche ben oltre New York. Mamdani non è mai stato il candidato del partito. Era Cuomo il candidato dei democratici. Dopo il risultato delle primarie di luglio, con la vittoria a sorpresa di Mamdani su Cuomo, i leader democratici hanno dovuto accettare una realtà piuttosto amara. Quella di non essere in sintonia con un movimento che aveva dilagato all’interno del loro stesso partito. Alcuni hanno scelto di venire a patti con la nuova realtà. La governatrice di New York, Kathy Hochul, ha annunciato quasi subito il sostegno a Mamdani. Altri ci hanno messo un po’ di più e l’hanno fatto </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">obtorto collo</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">. Tra questi, il leader dei deputati dem, Hakeem Jeffries, eletto a New York, che ha annunciato il suo </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">endorsement</span><span lang=\"it-IT\"> a Mamdani solo poche ore prima delle elezioni. Altri ancora non ce l’hanno proprio fatta. Qui, il nome che viene immediatamente alla mente è quello del leader dei senatori democratici, Chuck Schumer, eletto anche lui a New York, che non ha mai detto una sola parola su Mamdani durante tutta la campagna elettorale.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">Mentre il giovane socialista democratico trionfava a New York, Schumer, 74 anni – quaranta più di Mamdani – era a Washington a presidiare ai negoziati sullo </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">shutdown</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">. È però altamente significativo che Schumer fosse lontano proprio mentre nella sua città avveniva qualcosa di così travolgente e storico. Schumer, per tutta la campagna elettorale, aveva mantenuto un’attitudine di fredda distanza da Mamdani, mostrando di non considerare l’aspirante sindaco davvero parte dei democratici. Ma la notte del 4 novembre era Schumer ad apparire corpo estraneo a qualcosa che era nato, cresciuto, esploso nella sua città. A risultato ormai definito, Schumer ha finalmente telefonato a Mamdani, offrendogli “la collaborazione” dei senatori democratici. È però ovvio che lo scontro non è finito qua. La vecchia nomenclatura democratica vive la parte più giovane del partito – in particolare i settori progressisti, quelli dei Democratic Socialists of America – come una minaccia alla sua esistenza e alla possibilità stessa di tornare al governo di Washington. Appare altrettanto chiaro che una nuova generazione, tendenzialmente più a sinistra, reclama un ruolo nel partito e chiede la revisione della linea politica seguita sinora.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">Una guerra tra queste due “anime” sarebbe il regalo più grosso che i democratici potrebbero fare a Trump e ai repubblicani. Il v</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">oto di martedì, se rivela l’importanza dei temi economici e di “qualità della vita”, non offre un’indicazione particolare sui futuri orientamenti ideologici e di schieramento del partito. Mamdani è il prodotto di un ambiente radicale, urbano, cosmopolita, interclassista, che solo una città come New York poteva offrire. Formazione e orientamenti politici di Sherrill e Spanberger, due deputate moderate e pro-establishment, sono molto diversi. Sherrill è una ex ufficiale di marina ed ex procuratrice federale. Spanberger era un’agente della CIA. Va tra l’altro ricordato che il 4 novembre ha decretato il successo della “Proposition 50”, il referendum sul ridisegno della mappa elettorale sostenuto dal governatore della California Gavin Newsom. Newsom appartiene esattamente a quella nomenclatura del partito che l’anima più progressista contesta. Eppure, è uscito vittorioso, e rafforzato, </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">dal voto. Sarebbe dunque un errore dare una lettura univoca ai risultati del 4 novembre. Quello che il 4 novembre suggerisce è proprio il contrario, cioè la necessità di un partito democratico multiplo, plurale, capace di coltivare anime e orientamenti diversi, in grado di adattarsi alle situazioni locali, di esaltare le tante facce dell’America. Da questo punto di vista l’esempio di un politico come Bernie Sanders è emblematico. Sanders non ha mai smesso di battersi per principi e politiche progressiste e socialdemocratiche. Al tempo stesso, non ha mai fatto mancare il suo appoggio all’establishment democratico, da Hillary Clinton a Joe Biden, quando era in gioco Congresso e Casa Bianca</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"it-IT\">L’ultima riflessione che il voto di martedì suggerisce è qualcosa ancora </span><span lang=\"it-IT\">in nuce</span><span lang=\"it-IT\">. Più una suggestione, una sensazione, che un pensiero finito. Riguarda i possibili scenari della futura politica americana. Da Ronald Reagan in avanti, ciò che ha permesso ai repubblicani di conquistare potere e poteri – facendo avanzare un’agenda culturale conservatrice – è stata l’alleanza tra i molto ricchi e le classi lavoratrici respinte dal partito democratico. Questa alleanza non ha sempre funzionato, ma ha comunque garantito ai repubblicani di mettere le basi di quella rivoluzione conservatrice che vede in Trump il suo frutto più maturo e radicale. Il voto di martedì, in particolare quello di New York, mostra la possibilità di qualcosa di diverso. In particolare, il convergere di interessi e posizioni di classe lavoratrice, borghesia media e medio-alta, elettorato più giovane, fasce di più recente immigrazione. È una coalizione tenuta insieme dalla crisi di accessibilità economica, dalla sempre maggior impunità dei super ricchi, dalla perdita di diritti e libertà. È una coalizione di cui, al momento, si intravvede appunto solo il contorno indefinito, ma che potrebbe risultare decisiva per il futuro dei democratici americani.</span></p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: <strong>Zohran Mamdani wins New York mayoral election.

      "content": "<p align=\"left\">Nel mese di ottobre il ministro degli Esteri ungherese Péter Szijjártó è stato a Mosca per partecipare a una conferenza sull’energia. In quella circostanza il capo della diplomazia di Budapest ha definito “folli” i tentativi di diversificazione energetica dell’Ue finalizzati a dismettere gradualmente l’uso dei combustibili fossili. A suo parere è folle anche la pretesa di interrompere gli approvvigionamenti di gas e petrolio dalla Russia, d’altronde l’Ungheria dipende da queste forniture.<!--mitigo-paywall--> Secondo Bruxelles gli accordi bilaterali stipulati dagli stati membri devono rispettare la linea politica stabilita dall’Ue che, come già accennato, sta cercando di ridurre nella misura maggiore possibile i rapporti con la Russia. Così, all’interno dell’Unione la presenza di Szijjártó a Mosca è stata definita inopportuna considerando il momento storico e il contesto internazionale. Tutto questo mentre già fervevano i preparativi per la messa a punto del diciannovesimo pacchetto di sanzioni contro la Russia che comporta il divieto assoluto di importazione di gas naturale e liquido di quella provenienza e prevede sanzioni contro le compagnie petrolifere russe Rosneft e Gazprom Neft.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Non è comunque solo Budapest a prendere posizione nei confronti delle politiche energetiche dell’Ue. Oggi è da tenere a mente che queste scelte si collocano in un quadro più ampio, in cui la stessa strategia europea sulla transizione energetica e sul Green Deal appare in chiara difficoltà. Negli ultimi mesi sono emerse forti preoccupazioni riguardo a un possibile rallentamento o ridimensionamento del Green Deal europeo. Da un lato, alcuni governi e settori industriali sostengono che gli obiettivi ambientali siano troppo costosi e difficili da raggiungere in un contesto segnato da inflazione, crisi energetica e competizione globale, chiedendo più gradualità o deroghe. A certificare questa frenata è stato lo stesso Consiglio europeo, che ha giustificato il rallentamento in nome della “competitività”, a motivare la revisione o il rinvio di molte misure ambientali. Dall’altro, movimenti ambientalisti e una parte delle forze politiche temono che queste pressioni possano tradursi in un arretramento strutturale: meno investimenti nelle rinnovabili, rinvio degli obiettivi climatici e un ritorno a soluzioni fondate sui fossili o sull’agricoltura ad alta intensità.</p>\n<p>È dunque in questo contesto che già nel mese di giugno l’Ungheria e la Slovacchia hanno respinto il testo redatto da Bruxelles sulle modalità attraverso le quali far venir meno la dipendenza dell’Unione dal gas naturale e dal petrolio russi. Più precisamente, hanno posto il veto al piano REPowerEU concepito per mettere fine a queste forniture entro il 2027 in più tappe. Quella iniziale è prevista per il primo gennaio del 2026, data del divieto di firmare nuovi contratti, la seconda è quella del 17 giugno successivo per l’estinzione degli accordi a breve termine già stipulati, c’è poi la data del 31 dicembre del 2027 per la terminazione di quelli a lungo termine. Il tutto con una deroga prevista per i paesi privi di sbocco al mare come, appunto, l’Ungheria e la Slovacchia. I governi dei due paesi hanno bocciato questo programma e sostenuto una linea che rispetta maggiormente i loro interessi nazionali e la sicurezza energetica. Secondo il piano essi avrebbero, infatti, la possibilità di importare gas russo fino alla fine del 2027, ma né Budapest né Bratislava hanno apprezzato la tabella di marcia proposta dall’Unione e le sue finalità. Secondo Szijjártó “la politica energetica è di competenza nazionale”; a suo avviso il piano dell’Ue mette in pericolo la sovranità ungherese e la sua sicurezza energetica.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">La posizione dei governi ungherese e slovacco ha portato a delle frizioni con Bruxelles e impedito il formarsi di una posizione comune sulle sanzioni nei confronti di Mosca. Non solo Ungheria e Slovacchia seguono una linea diversa, ma i loro primi ministri si trovano d’accordo su diversi aspetti di politica interna ed estera: dalle politiche sull’immigrazione all’uso dei fondi di coesione, dall’agenda riguardante i rapporti con la comunità Lgbtq+ alla posizione nei confronti della Russia e dell’Ucraina. Sulla questione energetica, l’entità del vincolo con Mosca non è trascurabile, basti pensare che l’80% delle forniture di petrolio di cui di due paesi beneficiano viene dalla Russia. Nel 2021 l’Ungheria ha stabilito con la Russia degli accordi per la fornitura di 4,5 miliardi di metri cubi di gas, un accordo che se rispettato scadrebbe nel 2036. Così Budapest e Bratislava difendono questo assetto e ne fanno una questione di sovranità e di sicurezza energetica da garantire alle popolazioni che amministrano.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">L’opposizione partitica e sociale in Ungheria e in Slovacchia critica la vicinanza politica dei loro governi al sistema di Vladimir Putin; questo è stato uno dei temi delle proteste di piazza che si sono date in questi anni in entrambi i paesi. Per quanto riguarda l’approccio alla guerra tra Russia e l’Ucraina, il primo ministro ungherese Viktor Orbán è intenzionato a dar vita a un asse con Bratislava e Praga, dopo il successo elettorale ottenuto nella Repubblica Ceca da Andrej Babiš. Uomo politico e imprenditore, fondatore e leader di Ano 2011, partito nato in qualità di movimento di protesta contro la politica nazionale, già primo ministro nel periodo compreso fra il 2017 e il 2021, Babiš è noto come populista di destra. Orbán ha dunque in mente una triangolazione che sostenga le istanze prima esposte e che privilegi l’adesione all’Ue dei Balcani occidentali piuttosto che quella dell’Ucraina. Posizione che il premier ungherese esprime e motiva già da tempo sempre a protezione di una serie di interessi nazionali che confliggono con quanto auspicato da Bruxelles in termini geopolitici e non solo.</p>\n<h6 align=\"left\">CREDITI FOTO: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/it-it/foto/colpo-panoramico-del-cielo-247763/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></h6>\n<p>L'articolo <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/ungheria-slovacchia-e-la-questione-energetica/\">Ungheria, Slovacchia e la questione energetica</a> proviene da <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net\">MicroMega</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Una delle espressioni che è balzata alle cronache recentemente è “crypto scams 2025”, simbolo di un fenomeno in crescita che ha bruciato miliardi di dollari tra truffe, hack e frodi d’investimento. L’articolo analizza come la tecnologia blockchain, nata per garantire trasparenza e decentralizzazione, stia diventando anche l’arma principale per smascherare la criminalità digitale, con l’Italia tra i protagonisti nella ricerca e nelle investigazioni forensi.</p>\n<p>Nel 2024, gli americani hanno perso 16.6 miliardi di dollari a causa della criminalità informatica, di cui 9.3 miliardi direttamente legati alle criptovalute. Un paradosso singolare: le stesse tecnologie blockchain progettate per garantire privacy e decentralizzazione stanno diventando gli strumenti più potenti nelle mani degli investigatori digitali. La <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUxcsGbjKtM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Laura Ricci</a> dell&#8217;Università di Pisa lo spiega con efficacia: &#8220;La blockchain non è solo il registro delle transazioni Bitcoin, ma un vero e proprio notaio digitale che rende tracciabile ciò che i criminali credevano invisibile.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Questa contraddizione apparente nasconde una verità più complessa. Mentre le truffe crypto continuano a crescere del 66% anno su anno secondo l&#8217;FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center, le forze dell&#8217;ordine stanno affinando tecniche investigative che sfruttano proprio l&#8217;immutabilità e la trasparenza delle blockchain pubbliche. Il risultato? Una corsa agli armamenti tecnologica dove ogni nuovo strumento di anonimizzazione trova la sua contromisura forense.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;anatomia tecnica dell&#8217;investigazione blockchain: oltre il mito dell&#8217;anonimato</h2>\n<p>Quando Ross Ulbricht lanciò Silk Road nel 2011, credeva che l&#8217;anonimato di Tor combinato con i pagamenti in Bitcoin avrebbe creato un mercato nero invulnerabile. Non aveva fatto i conti con una realtà fondamentale: Bitcoin non offre anonimato, ma pseudo-anonimato. La differenza è abissale.</p>\n<p>Ogni transazione Bitcoin lascia tracce indelebili sulla blockchain. Gli investigatori forensi utilizzano tecniche sofisticate di <strong>address clustering</strong> per collegare indirizzi apparentemente scollegati alla stessa entità. L&#8217;euristica più potente è la common input heuristic: quando più indirizzi Bitcoin vengono utilizzati come input nella stessa transazione, con alta probabilità appartengono allo stesso wallet o utente. Chainalysis, leader globale nell&#8217;analisi blockchain con oltre 100 euristiche proprietarie che monitorano 25+ blockchain, ha costruito il suo impero su questo principio.</p>\n<p>Ma c&#8217;è di più. La <strong>change address detection</strong> permette di distinguere quali output di una transazione rappresentano il pagamento reale e quali sono il &#8220;resto&#8221; che torna al mittente. Tecniche di <strong>graph analysis</strong> trasformano la blockchain in una rete sociale dove algoritmi come PageRank identificano nodi centrali nelle reti criminali. La <strong>taint analysis</strong> traccia la &#8220;contaminazione&#8221; dei fondi attraverso catene di transazioni, quantificando matematicamente quanto denaro pulito si mescola con fondi illeciti.</p>\n<p>Il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory, guidato dalla Prof. Ricci con 3 membri permanenti, 2 post-doc e 6 dottorandi, ha contribuito significativamente a questa scienza emergente. Le loro ricerche sulla struttura &#8220;bow tie&#8221; del grafo degli utenti Bitcoin hanno rivelato pattern comportamentali che distinguono attività legittime da schemi di riciclaggio. Quando i Carabinieri italiani, attraverso il Maggiore Simone Vecchiarello della Sezione Criptovalute del Comando Antifalsificazione Monetaria, applicano questi algoritmi sul campo, i risultati sono tangibili: operazioni che portano al sequestro di milioni in asset digitali.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;epidemia delle investment fraud: 6.57 miliardi evaporati nel 2024 – il volto delle crypto scams 2025</h2>\n<p>Se dovessimo identificare il volto dominante della criminalità crypto nel 2024, sarebbe quello delle investment fraud. Con 6.57 miliardi di dollari persi secondo l&#8217;FBI IC3 Report, rappresentano il 40% di tutte le perdite legate a criptovalute. Non stiamo parlando di hack tecnici o exploit di smart contract, ma di ingegneria sociale applicata con precisione chirurgica.</p>\n<p>Le truffe &#8220;pig butchering&#8221; meritano attenzione particolare per la loro sofisticazione psicologica. Il termine, traduzione letterale del cinese &#8220;sha zhu pan&#8221; (letteralmente &#8220;piatto di maiale macellato&#8221;), descrive una truffa in più fasi dove la vittima viene &#8220;ingrassata&#8221; con piccoli guadagni iniziali prima della &#8220;macellazione&#8221; finale. Il truffatore costruisce una relazione online, spesso romantica, che può durare settimane o mesi. Introduce gradualmente opportunità di investimento in criptovalute, mostrandosi esperto e condividendo screenshot di profitti apparentemente reali. Quando la vittima investe somme significative, i fondi spariscono e con loro il truffatore.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;impatto demografico è devastante. Le vittime over-60 hanno perso 4.885 miliardi di dollari nel 2024, rappresentando il 52% delle perdite totali da investment fraud. Questi numeri raccontano una storia di vulnerabilità generazionale: una popolazione cresciuta nell&#8217;era pre-digitale si confronta con truffe progettate da nativi digitali che sfruttano sofisticati bias cognitivi.</p>\n<h2>Hack da record: quando 1.5 miliardi evaporano in una notte</h2>\n<p>Febbraio 2025 ha segnato un punto di svolta nella storia della criminalità crypto. ByBit, uno dei maggiori exchange al mondo, ha subito il furto più grande della storia: 1.5 miliardi di dollari spariti in quella che l&#8217;FBI ha formalmente attribuito alla Corea del Nord attraverso una Public Service Announcement pubblicata il 26 febbraio 2025.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;attacco dimostra l&#8217;evoluzione delle capacità offensive degli stati-nazione nel dominio crypto. Il gruppo Lazarus, braccio cyber del regime nordcoreano, ha mostrato una padronanza tecnica che combina social engineering avanzato, infiltrazione delle infrastrutture IT e conoscenza profonda dei protocolli blockchain. Secondo Chainalysis, al 31 luglio 2025 i furti totali hanno raggiunto 2.17 miliardi di dollari, con gli exchange che assorbono il 76.65% delle perdite.</p>\n<p>Ma c&#8217;è un dettaglio che sfugge alle statistiche aggregate: il 23.35% dei furti ha colpito wallet personali, con 8.5 miliardi di dollari in crypto rubate ancora detenute on-chain. Questi &#8220;wrench attacks&#8221; rappresentano un&#8217;evoluzione inquietante del crimine crypto. Non servono più exploit zero-day o vulnerabilità dei smart contract: basta violenza fisica o minacce credibili per ottenere seed phrase e chiavi private. È il ritorno a forme di criminalità brutalmente tradizionali applicate a tecnologie ultramoderne.</p>\n<h2>Ransomware: il declino inaspettato che spiega più di quanto sembri</h2>\n<p>Se c&#8217;è una statistica che sorprende nell&#8217;anno della crescita esponenziale delle truffe crypto, è questa: i pagamenti ransomware sono crollati del 35.82% nel 2024, scendendo a 813.55 milioni di dollari dai 1.25 miliardi dell&#8217;anno precedente. Chainalysis attribuisce questo declino a tre fattori convergenti: maggiore resilienza delle vittime che rifiutano di pagare, operazioni di law enforcement più efficaci contro le gang ransomware, e migliore cyber hygiene aziendale.</p>\n<p>Ma questo apparente successo nasconde una realtà più complessa. Il numero di attacchi ransomware non è diminuito significativamente; è diminuito il tasso di successo dei pagamenti. Le aziende stanno imparando che pagare non garantisce il recupero dei dati e finanzia ulteriori attacchi. Le banche dati di backup offline stanno diventando standard, rendendo meno critico il pagamento del riscatto.</p>\n<p>Contemporaneamente, le frodi ai crypto ATM sono esplose del 99% in termini di complaint (anche se le perdite monetarie sono aumentate del 31%), raggiungendo 246.7 milioni di dollari secondo l&#8217;FBI. Questo spostamento rivela un pattern: quando una modalità di attacco diventa meno profittevole, i criminali migrano rapidamente verso vettori alternativi. I crypto ATM offrono vantaggio cruciale: anonimato operativo e conversione immediata cash-to-crypto senza KYC rigoroso.</p>\n<h2>Silk Road, FTX e Bitfinex: lezioni magistrali di analisi forense</h2>\n<p>Alcuni casi studio trascendono la cronaca criminale per diventare manuali operativi dell&#8217;investigazione blockchain. Silk Road rimane l&#8217;archetipo: quando l&#8217;FBI arrestò Ross Ulbricht nell&#8217;ottobre 2013, sequestrando oltre 600,000 Bitcoin (successivamente convertiti in oltre un miliardo di dollari), l&#8217;operazione combinò <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/osint-caos-digitale/\">OSINT</a> tradizionale e analisi blockchain pionieristica.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;errore fatale di Ulbricht? Un post su un forum nel 2011 dove l&#8217;username &#8220;altoid&#8221; aveva promosso Silk Road indicando l&#8217;email &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:rossulbricht@gmail.com\">rossulbricht@gmail.com</a>&#8221; per ulteriori informazioni. L&#8217;analisi forense blockchain fece il resto: tracciare commissioni attraverso migliaia di transazioni, identificare pattern di consolidamento nei wallet, correlare temporalmente depositi e prelievi. La lezione è chiara: l&#8217;anonimato è una catena, forte quanto il suo anello più debole.</p>\n<p>FTX rappresenta il polo opposto dello spettro criminale. Non un mercato nero costruito sull&#8217;anonimato, ma una frode finanziaria da 8 miliardi di dollari perpetrata in piena luce, con l&#8217;apparenza di legittimità. Nansen Analytics ha tracciato 280 milioni di token FTT (80% del supply totale) controllati da entità FTX/Alameda, rivelando la manipolazione sistemica che sosteneva l&#8217;impero di Sam Bankman-Fried. Quando FTX è collassato, 477 milioni di dollari sono stati rubati in circostanze ancora poco chiare, con 74 milioni riciclati ironicamente attraverso RenBridge, un servizio controllato dalla stessa Alameda Research.</p>\n<p>Ma è il caso Bitfinex che dimostra la pazienza metodica dell&#8217;analisi forense blockchain. Nel 2016, hacker sconosciuti rubarono 119,754 Bitcoin dall&#8217;exchange (circa 72 milioni di dollari all&#8217;epoca). Per cinque anni, gli investigatori hanno tracciato meticolosamente ogni movimento di questi fondi attraverso exchange, mixer e wallet. Nel febbraio 2022, l&#8217;FBI ha arrestato Ilya Lichtenstein e Heather Morgan, sequestrando 94,000 Bitcoin valutati 3.6 miliardi di dollari al momento del sequestro (oltre 10 miliardi ai prezzi attuali).</p>\n<p>La tecnica chiave? Peeling chain analysis: seguire la &#8220;spellatura&#8221; sistematica di un grande wallet in porzioni sempre più piccole attraverso migliaia di transazioni. Ma il breakthrough decisivo venne da errori operativi offline: acquisti con gift card Walmart pagati in Bitcoin tracciabili a conti personali. Ancora una volta, la lezione è che la blockchain forense funziona meglio quando combinata con investigazione tradizionale.</p>\n<h2>Italia in prima linea: ecosistema di eccellenza tra ricerca e law enforcement</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;Italia sta costruendo un ecosistema crypto forensics tra i più avanzati d&#8217;Europa, combinando ricerca accademica d&#8217;avanguardia, forze dell&#8217;ordine altamente specializzate e framework normativi progressivi. Questa sinergia multi-attore rappresenta un modello di riferimento internazionale.</p>\n<p>Il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory guida la ricerca accademica italiana. La Prof. Laura Ricci, coordinatrice del curriculum &#8220;Sistemi sociali e società smart&#8221; nel Dottorato Nazionale in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies ed ex membro del gruppo di esperti del Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico per la strategia nazionale blockchain (2018-2019), ha creato un laboratorio con 3 membri permanenti, 2 post-doc, 2 ricercatori CNR e 6 dottorandi. Le pubblicazioni su graph analysis, detection di comportamenti artificiali e clustering di indirizzi Bitcoin non restano confinate alle riviste peer-reviewed: diventano algoritmi operativi per le forze dell&#8217;ordine.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Osservatorio Blockchain &amp; Web3 del Politecnico di Milano, nato nel 2018, rappresenta il polo di riferimento nazionale per l&#8217;analisi del mercato blockchain. Con la collaborazione tra il Dipartimento di Ingegneria Gestionale e il Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, l&#8217;Osservatorio monitora 2,033 progetti globali dal 2016, quantificando il mercato italiano blockchain a 42 milioni di euro con crescita del 50% annuale. Il Blockchain Innovation &amp; Solutions HUB facilita ricerca applicata pre-competitiva tra aziende, università e istituzioni.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Università di Perugia ospita il Cybersecurity Lab diretto dal Prof. Stefano Bistarelli, vincitore del Microsoft Azure Research Award per il progetto &#8220;Data Science for investigating the block-chain in Bitcoin&#8221;. Il laboratorio sviluppa tecniche per identificare indirizzi blockchain utilizzati per attività illecite, contribuendo alla formazione di &#8220;hacker etici&#8221; attraverso CyberChallenge.IT.</p>\n<p>Sul fronte operativo, i Carabinieri hanno istituito strutture specializzate uniche in Europa. Il Maggiore Simone Vecchiarello guida la Sezione Criptovalute del Comando Carabinieri Antifalsificazione Monetaria, sviluppando script proprietari per la ricostruzione di seed phrase e tecniche avanzate di analisi on-chain che combinano Chainalysis Reactor con tool interni. L&#8217;operazione Franco Lee ha dimostrato queste capacità: smantellamento di una rete da 8.8 milioni di euro con sequestro di Bitcoin, USDT, Ethereum e Matic.</p>\n<p>La Guardia di Finanza opera attraverso due nuclei specialistici d&#8217;eccellenza. Il Nucleo Speciale Tutela Privacy e Frodi Tecnologiche, con 5 gruppi investigativi dedicati, monitora costantemente Clear Web, Dark Web e Deep Web per individuare riciclaggio e finanziamento del terrorismo. Utilizza software avanzati di blockchain analysis per tracciare wallet anonimi e transazioni sospette. Il Nucleo Speciale Polizia Valutaria si concentra sul contrasto ai flussi finanziari illeciti, collaborando strettamente con il Nucleo Privacy per operazioni congiunte.</p>\n<p>Le operazioni recenti testimoniano l&#8217;efficacia di questa specializzazione: sequestro di 11 milioni di euro in Bitcoin e Avalanche per evasione fiscale (prima operazione europea di questa portata), individuazione di un trader con cripto-attività per 270 milioni di euro, e sequestro di wallet da 9 milioni di dollari creato con documenti falsi e deepfake. La Guardia di Finanza ha redatto una &#8220;Guida Operativa sulle investigazioni tecnologiche&#8221; distribuita a tutti i reparti, e partecipa a master universitari presso le Università &#8220;Tor Vergata&#8221; e &#8220;La Sapienza&#8221; di Roma, creando un circolo virtuoso tra formazione e operatività.</p>\n<p>La Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni ha gestito 54,554 fascicoli nel 2024, con truffe online che hanno sottratto 181 milioni di euro (+32% rispetto al 2023). Questi numeri raccontano pressione criminale crescente ma anche capacità investigativa in evoluzione, con cooperazione internazionale continua attraverso Europol, Interpol ed EPPO.</p>\n<p>Il framework normativo completa l&#8217;ecosistema. L&#8217;implementazione del regolamento MiCAR attraverso il Decreto Legislativo 129/2024 ha creato supervisione condivisa tra Banca d&#8217;Italia e CONSOB, posizionando l&#8217;Italia tra i primi paesi europei con compliance piena alle direttive comunitarie. Questa rapidità normativa, combinata con eccellenza accademica e specializzazione operativa, trasforma l&#8217;Italia in un laboratorio dove innovazione tecnologica e legalità non sono antagonisti ma alleati strategici nella guerra globale contro la criminalità finanziaria digitale.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;arsenale tecnologico: quando l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale incontra la blockchain</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;analisi forense blockchain del 2025 è irriconoscibile rispetto a quella di cinque anni fa. Le piattaforme professionali come Chainalysis Reactor non si limitano più a tracciare transazioni: utilizzano machine learning per predire comportamenti, identificare pattern anomali in tempo reale, e assegnare risk scores automatizzati a indirizzi e transazioni.</p>\n<p>Elliptic, con il suo database di 6.4 miliardi di indirizzi etichettati su 43 reti blockchain, applica Graph Neural Networks (GNN) per migliorare l&#8217;accuratezza del clustering del 10-15% rispetto ai metodi tradizionali. Ma è nell&#8217;applicazione di algoritmi di ransomware detection che il machine learning mostra risultati impressionanti: modelli basati su Random Forest e XGBoost raggiungono F1-score tra 0.85 e 0.95, con picchi di accuratezza del 99.5% su dataset di transazioni Bitcoin correlate a ransomware.</p>\n<p>La ricerca accademica sta esplorando frontiere ancora più avanzate. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) analizzano reti di transazioni con accuratezza superiore del 15% rispetto ai metodi classici, identificando anomalie comportamentali che sfuggono all&#8217;occhio umano e agli algoritmi tradizionali. Natural Language Processing applicato al monitoraggio del dark web correla menzioni di indirizzi crypto con coordinamento criminale, creando intelligence actionable in tempo reale.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, questa potenza computazionale solleva questioni etiche profonde. Quando sistemi di intelligenza artificiale possono tracciare ogni movimento finanziario di un individuo attraverso la blockchain, dove tracciamo il confine tra sicurezza e sorveglianza di massa? Il GDPR europeo introduce tensioni fondamentali: come garantire il &#8220;diritto all&#8217;oblio&#8221; su una tecnologia progettata per essere immutabile?</p>\n<h2>Privacy versus sicurezza: il dilemma irrisolto delle privacy coin</h2>\n<p>Monero rappresenta la risposta tecnologica più sofisticata al problema della privacy blockchain. Con ring signatures, stealth addresses e RingCT che oscurano mittente, destinatario e ammontare di ogni transazione, Monero rimane largamente intracciabile nonostante l&#8217;IRS abbia offerto 1.25 milioni di dollari in contratti (625,000 dollari ciascuno a Chainalysis e Integra FEC) per sviluppare strumenti di tracciamento.</p>\n<p>Il fallimento di questi sforzi non è tecnologico ma fondamentale: Monero è progettato con privacy-by-default a livello protocollare, non come funzione aggiuntiva. Zcash offre privacy attraverso zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), ma la sua scelta di rendere le transazioni schermate opzionali lo rende vulnerabile: meno dell&#8217;1% delle transazioni sono fully shielded, creando un &#8220;anonymity set&#8221; troppo piccolo per garantire vera privacy.</p>\n<p>Questo solleva domande scomode. Se tecnologie come Monero rendono impossibile il tracciamento, dovrebbero essere bandite? O il diritto alla privacy finanziaria è fondamentale in una società libera? Non esistono risposte semplici. I difensori della privacy citano diritti costituzionali e la necessità di proteggere dissidenti politici, whistleblower e cittadini in regimi autoritari. Gli investigatori sottolineano che la stessa tecnologia facilita terrorismo, traffico di esseri umani e pedopornografia.</p>\n<p>Il futuro potrebbe risiedere in approcci intermedi. Zero-knowledge proofs permettono di provare proprietà di dati senza rivelare i dati stessi. È teoricamente possibile costruire sistemi dove un&#8217;autorità giudiziaria possa ottenere informazioni su transazioni specifiche attraverso meccanismi di &#8220;privacy selettiva&#8221;, mantenendo anonimato per tutti gli altri. Ma implementare questi sistemi senza backdoor sfruttabili da attori malintenzionati rimane una sfida ingegneristica aperta.</p>\n<h2>La minaccia quantistica: quando la crittografia diventa obsoleta</h2>\n<p>Esiste una minaccia esistenziale che aleggia su tutta la crittografia moderna: il quantum computing. Gli algoritmi di Shor, eseguiti su computer quantistici sufficientemente potenti, potrebbero rompere gli schemi di firma digitale ECDSA che proteggono Bitcoin ed Ethereum. Il consenso accademico e degli esperti NIST colloca questa minaccia in un orizzonte temporale di 10-15 anni.</p>\n<p>Il problema non è ipotetico. Ogni transazione Bitcoin espone temporaneamente la chiave pubblica, che un quantum computer potrebbe teoricamente usare per derivare la chiave privata. Fondi in indirizzi &#8220;pay-to-public-key&#8221; non ancora spesi sono particolarmente vulnerabili. Si stima che tra 2 e 5 milioni di Bitcoin (valore attuale superiore a 200 miliardi di dollari) siano in indirizzi vulnerabili, molti appartenenti agli early adopter incluso Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>\n<p>La comunità cripto è consapevole del rischio. Sono in sviluppo algoritmi di firma post-quantum come Lattice-based cryptography e Hash-based signatures. Ma la migrazione richiederà un hard fork coordinato delle principali blockchain, un processo politicamente complesso e tecnicamente rischioso. La finestra temporale è stretta: dobbiamo implementare crittografia post-quantum prima che computer quantistici sufficientemente potenti diventino disponibili, ma evitare migrazioni premature verso algoritmi non sufficientemente testati.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive future: tra regolamentazione e innovazione tecnologica</h2>\n<p>Il 2025 segna un punto di inflessione nella guerra contro la criminalità crypto. La regolamentazione MiCAR in Europa, l&#8217;implementazione italiana attraverso il Decreto Legislativo 129/2024 con supervisione di Banca d&#8217;Italia e CONSOB, e gli sforzi di armonizzazione normativa globale stanno creando un framework dove innovazione tecnologica e compliance non sono antagonisti.</p>\n<p>Le sfide rimangono monumentali. Le forze dell&#8217;ordine devono processare oltre 100 milioni di transazioni giornaliere attraverso blockchain multiple, identificando in tempo reale quelle sospette. La scarsità di dati di addestramento etichettati limita l&#8217;efficacia dei modelli di machine learning. Le tecniche criminali evolvono più rapidamente degli aggiornamenti dei modelli investigativi.</p>\n<p>Ma emerge anche motivo di cauto ottimismo. La collaborazione tra accademia, industria e law enforcement sta dando frutti concreti. Centri di eccellenza come il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory, l&#8217;Osservatorio Blockchain &amp; Web3 del Politecnico di Milano, e il Cybersecurity Lab dell&#8217;Università di Perugia dimostrano che la ricerca può tradursi rapidamente in capacità operative. L&#8217;Italia, con la sua combinazione di eccellenza accademica e forze dell&#8217;ordine sempre più specializzate, si posiziona all&#8217;avanguardia di questa battaglia.</p>\n<p>Il futuro della sicurezza blockchain dipenderà dalla nostra capacità di bilanciare tre imperativi apparentemente in conflitto: preservare l&#8217;innovazione tecnologica che rende le criptovalute rivoluzionarie, proteggere i diritti di privacy dei cittadini onesti, e fornire alle forze dell&#8217;ordine strumenti efficaci per combattere criminalità che non conosce confini. Non è un equilibrio facile da trovare, ma è l&#8217;unico percorso sostenibile per un futuro dove finanza decentralizzata e sicurezza possano coesistere.</p>\n<p>La battaglia contro i crypto scams non è solo tecnologica, ma profondamente umana: richiede vigilanza, educazione, cooperazione internazionale e la volontà di adattare continuamente strumenti e strategie a un panorama criminale in costante evoluzione. I 16.6 miliardi di dollari persi nel 2024 non sono solo statistiche, ma vite devastate, risparmi evaporati, fiducia tradita. Ogni caso risolto, ogni milione recuperato, ogni rete criminale smantellata rappresenta non solo una vittoria investigativa, ma un passo verso un ecosistema crypto più sicuro, più trasparente e più degno della fiducia che milioni di persone vi ripongono.</p>\n<h2>Fonti:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-annual-internet-crime-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Bureau of Investigation.

      "content": "<p>Quando si parla di acquisizione transfrontaliera di <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/pubblicazioni/digital-forensics-nel-processo-penale/\">prove digitali nei procedimenti penali</a>, ci troviamo di fronte a una delle sfide più complesse che il diritto processuale penale europeo abbia mai affrontato. Non si tratta semplicemente di armonizzare procedure: stiamo ridisegnando il rapporto tra sovranità nazionale, tutela dei diritti fondamentali e necessità investigative in un ecosistema digitale dove i dati non rispettano confini geografici e i <em>provider</em> di servizi possono trovarsi a migliaia di chilometri dalla giurisdizione richiedente.</p>\n<p>Gli schemi di decreto legislativo attualmente all&#8217;esame delle Commissioni parlamentari italiane – <a href=\"https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:1999-07-30;303~art3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">l&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 303</a> e <a href=\"https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-02-01&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0023\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">l&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 330</a> – rappresentano il tentativo italiano di dare attuazione a questo nuovo paradigma normativo. Ma al di là della mera trasposizione tecnica delle norme europee, questi provvedimenti sollevano questioni che toccano il cuore stesso della <em>digital forensics</em>, della cooperazione investigativa e della tutela dei diritti nella società dell&#8217;informazione.</p>\n<h2>Dal sistema tradizionale alla rivoluzione E-Evidence: un cambio di paradigma</h2>\n<p>Per comprendere appieno la portata innovativa del <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/it/policies/e-evidence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pacchetto E-Evidence</a>, è necessario inquadrarlo nel più ampio sistema di cooperazione internazionale in materia di <em>cybercrime</em>. La <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/il-potenziamento-della-cooperazione-internazionale-in-materia-di-cybercrime-e-prove-elettroniche/\">Convenzione di Budapest</a> del 2001 ha rappresentato per oltre vent&#8217;anni il <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/convenzione-onu-cyber/\">principale strumento di cooperazione</a>, introducendo meccanismi di assistenza giudiziaria reciproca specificamente pensati per i reati informatici.</p>\n<p>Il Secondo Protocollo Addizionale alla Convenzione, adottato dal Comitato dei Ministri del Consiglio d&#8217;Europa il 17 novembre 2021 e aperto alla firma il 12 maggio 2022, ha tentato di modernizzare questi strumenti, introducendo procedure accelerate e contatti diretti tra autorità. Tuttavia, anche questi aggiornamenti non hanno risolto il problema strutturale che affligge l&#8217;investigazione digitale transfrontaliera: i tempi della cooperazione giudiziaria tradizionale, spesso nell&#8217;ordine di mesi, collidono frontalmente con la volatilità delle prove elettroniche, che possono essere cancellate in pochi secondi o automaticamente sovrascritte da <em>retention policies</em> aggressive.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Ordine Europeo di Indagine, introdotto dalla <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0041\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Direttiva 2014/41/UE</a> e recepito in Italia con il decreto legislativo 21 giugno 2017, n. 108, ha semplificato le procedure tra Stati membri dell&#8217;UE sostituendo il sistema delle rogatorie con uno strumento più agile basato sul principio del riconoscimento reciproco. Eppure, anche l&#8217;OEI mantiene il modello della cooperazione «verticale» attraverso le autorità giudiziarie dello Stato di esecuzione, con i conseguenti tempi di tramitazione che, per quanto ridotti rispetto alle rogatorie tradizionali, rimangono incompatibili con l&#8217;urgenza di molte investigazioni digitali.</p>\n<p>Il <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1543\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Regolamento UE 2023/1543</a> e la <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32023L1544\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Direttiva UE 2023/1544</a>, pubblicati nella Gazzetta Ufficiale dell&#8217;Unione Europea il 28 luglio 2023, rappresentano un salto paradigmatico che alcuni studiosi hanno definito «post-westfaliano» perché mette in discussione il principio tradizionale della territorialità della giurisdizione penale. Per la prima volta, viene introdotta la cooperazione «orizzontale», permettendo alle autorità giudiziarie di rivolgersi direttamente ai prestatori di servizi stabiliti in altri Stati membri, bypassando il necessario coinvolgimento preventivo dell&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione. Questa innovazione solleva interrogativi profondi sul bilanciamento tra efficienza investigativa e tutela dei diritti fondamentali, tra necessità di rapidità e garanzie processuali, tra cooperazione europea e sovranità nazionale.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;architettura del sistema italiano: autorità, procedure e <em>governance</em></h2>\n<p>La decisione del Consiglio dei Ministri dell&#8217;8 ottobre 2025 ha designato il Ministero della Giustizia quale autorità centrale per la gestione del sistema E-Evidence sul territorio nazionale, ma l&#8217;architettura operativa che emerge dalla bozza dell&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 303 è significativamente più complessa e stratificata. Il primo nodo da sciogliere riguarda l&#8217;individuazione delle autorità di emissione competenti, una questione che il regolamento europeo affronta attraverso una graduazione basata sulla tipologia e sull&#8217;invasività dei dati richiesti.</p>\n<h3>La tassonomia dei dati e le implicazioni per le autorità competenti</h3>\n<p>Quando parliamo di prove digitali, la distinzione tra le diverse categorie di dati non è meramente accademica ma ha profonde implicazioni forensi, probatorie e, soprattutto, in termini di tutela dei diritti fondamentali. I dati relativi agli abbonati, quelli che il regolamento definisce come <em>subscriber data</em>, comprendono le informazioni fornite dall&#8217;utente al momento della registrazione del servizio: nome, cognome, <em>alias</em> o <em>username</em>, indirizzo email, numero di telefono, indirizzo postale, data di nascita, informazioni di pagamento come le ultime quattro cifre della carta di credito o l&#8217;IBAN, data di creazione dell&#8217;account e stato dello stesso.</p>\n<p>Questi dati, considerati relativamente poco invasivi perché già condivisi volontariamente dall&#8217;utente con il <em>provider</em>, possono essere richiesti tramite un ordine emesso o convalidato da un pubblico ministero. Il loro valore investigativo risiede principalmente nell&#8217;identificazione del soggetto e nella possibilità di correlare identità digitali multiple che una stessa persona può utilizzare su piattaforme diverse.</p>\n<p>I dati di accesso, o <em>access data</em>, rappresentano un salto qualitativo in termini di invasività. Si tratta delle informazioni tecniche relative alle connessioni: indirizzo IP di connessione, <em>timestamp</em> precisi di <em>login</em> e <em>logout</em>, <em>user agent</em> che rivela il <em>browser</em> e il sistema operativo utilizzato, eventuale geolocalizzazione se disponibile, tipo di dispositivo, identificativi di sessione.</p>\n<p>Questi dati, generati automaticamente dai sistemi al momento dell&#8217;accesso, permettono di ricostruire la <em>timeline</em> di attività dell&#8217;utente, di determinare la sua geolocalizzazione approssimativa attraverso l&#8217;analisi degli indirizzi IP e di identificare i dispositivi specifici utilizzati. Dal punto di vista forense, sono particolarmente preziosi ma anche estremamente volatili, spesso conservati per periodi limitati in base alle <em>data retention policies</em> dei <em>provider</em>. Anche per questi dati, il regolamento consente che l&#8217;autorità di emissione sia il pubblico ministero.</p>\n<p>La situazione si complica quando entriamo nel territorio dei dati relativi alle operazioni, i <em>transactional data</em> che la giurisprudenza della Corte di Giustizia dell&#8217;Unione Europea considera altamente invasivi anche se non includono il contenuto effettivo delle comunicazioni. Nel caso delle email, si tratta degli <em>header</em> completi che rivelano mittente, destinatari in chiaro, in copia e in copia nascosta, l&#8217;oggetto del messaggio, i <em>timestamp</em> precisi e il <em>route</em> seguito dal messaggio attraverso i server. Per le chiamate VoIP, comprendono i numeri del chiamante e del chiamato, la durata della conversazione e i <em>timestamp</em>.</p>\n<p>Per i servizi di messaggistica, si tratta dell&#8217;elenco delle comunicazioni con tutti i metadati ma senza il contenuto dei messaggi. Questi dati permettono di mappare le reti di contatti, di identificare possibili complici, di ricostruire <em>pattern</em> comunicativi che possono essere rivelatori quanto il contenuto stesso delle comunicazioni. La Corte di Giustizia, nelle celebri sentenze <em>Digital Rights Ireland</em> e <em>Tele2 Sverige</em>, ha equiparato l&#8217;accesso massivo a questi dati a una forma di sorveglianza che può rivelare informazioni intime sulla vita privata delle persone. Per questo motivo, il regolamento richiede garanzie più elevate.</p>\n<p>Infine, i <em>content data</em> rappresentano il livello massimo di invasività: il corpo dei messaggi email, il contenuto delle chat, i file allegati, le foto e i video condivisi, i documenti caricati su servizi di <em>cloud storage</em>, i post pubblicati sui <em>social media</em>. Si tratta del contenuto effettivo delle comunicazioni private, che richiede le tutele più stringenti. Per questi dati, il regolamento impone che l&#8217;autorità di emissione sia un giudice, un tribunale o un giudice istruttore, escludendo esplicitamente la competenza del pubblico ministero.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve mappare con precisione chirurgica le autorità nazionali su questo schema europeo, e qui emergono le peculiarità del nostro ordinamento processuale penale. Il pubblico ministero italiano è magistrato inquirente ma non organo giurisdizionale, una distinzione che diventa cruciale soprattutto per i dati relativi alle operazioni e ai contenuti, dove la giurisprudenza europea ha stabilito standard elevati di tutela che richiedono un controllo genuinamente giurisdizionale. Il riferimento naturale per i dati più invasivi sarebbe al giudice per le indagini preliminari, ma il decreto dovrà chiarire se in fase dibattimentale la competenza passi al giudice del dibattimento o rimanga comunque al GIP.</p>\n<h3>Il caso delle emergenze e la questione della polizia giudiziaria</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 7 del regolamento prevede che, in casi di urgenza debitamente accertati, gli ordini europei di produzione possano essere emessi da «qualsiasi altra autorità competente» purché seguiti da convalida giudiziaria entro ventiquattro ore. La formulazione è volutamente ampia per consentire agli Stati membri di adattarla ai propri ordinamenti, ma solleva questioni delicate quando si tratta di attribuire questo potere alla polizia giudiziaria. La legge di delegazione europea 2024 prevede che il Governo coordini le disposizioni nazionali per consentire agli organi di polizia giudiziaria di emettere ordini europei di produzione in casi di emergenza.</p>\n<p>Questa previsione rappresenta un&#8217;innovazione significativa nel nostro sistema processuale, dove la polizia giudiziaria opera tradizionalmente sotto la direzione e il controllo del pubblico ministero ai sensi dell&#8217;articolo 109 della Costituzione e degli articoli 347-348 del codice di procedura penale. Un EPOC emesso autonomamente dalla polizia giudiziaria, anche con successiva convalida, configura uno spazio di autonomia operativa che necessita di essere circoscritto con parametri rigorosi.</p>\n<p>Il decreto dovrà probabilmente limitare questa facoltà a situazioni di reale necessità e urgenza: pericolo imminente di perdita irreparabile delle prove, situazioni di pericolo di vita, indagini su atti di terrorismo o criminalità organizzata transnazionale dove ogni ora può essere decisiva. La convalida giudiziaria entro ventiquattro ore dovrà essere effettiva e non meramente formale, con l&#8217;obbligo per l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria di verificare non solo i presupposti sostanziali dell&#8217;ordine ma anche la sussistenza delle condizioni di urgenza che hanno giustificato l&#8217;emissione da parte della polizia giudiziaria.</p>\n<h3>Il coordinamento con la Direzione Nazionale Antimafia: un tassello cruciale</h3>\n<p>Un aspetto che potrebbe apparire marginale a una lettura superficiale, ma che rivela la sua importanza strategica nell&#8217;ottica del coordinamento investigativo nazionale, è l&#8217;obbligo di trasmettere copia dei certificati EPOC ed EPOC-PR al Procuratore Nazionale Antimafia quando si riferiscono a procedimenti per i delitti indicati all&#8217;articolo 51, comma 3-<em>bis</em> e 3-<em>quater</em> del codice di procedura penale. Si tratta dei delitti di criminalità organizzata, terrorismo, criminalità transnazionale, traffico di stupefacenti, armi ed esseri umani.</p>\n<p>La <em>ratio</em> di questa previsione, inserita nella legge di delegazione, risponde a logiche di coordinamento investigativo fondamentali nel contrasto alla criminalità organizzata: la Direzione Nazionale Antimafia deve avere contezza in tempo reale delle indagini transfrontaliere che potrebbero interconnettersi con altre investigazioni in corso su organizzazioni criminali, permettendo di individuare collegamenti, di evitare sovrapposizioni o conflitti tra procedimenti, di coordinare strategie investigative complesse che coinvolgono più procure.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista tecnico, questo significa che il sistema informatico decentrato dovrà prevedere meccanismi automatizzati di <em>routing</em> delle comunicazioni verso la DNA, con adeguate misure di sicurezza e tracciabilità. La sfida tecnica è garantire che questa trasmissione avvenga in tempo reale o <em>near-real-time</em>, senza creare colli di bottiglia procedurali che rallenterebbero l&#8217;intero meccanismo.</p>\n<h3>Il sistema informatico decentrato: l&#8217;infrastruttura critica invisibile</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 25 del Regolamento 2023/1543 prevede l&#8217;istituzione di un sistema informatico decentrato per la comunicazione sicura e lo scambio di dati tra le autorità competenti e i prestatori di servizi. La terminologia tecnica e burocratica rischia di oscurare la portata di questa infrastruttura: non si tratta di un semplice sistema di messaggistica ma dell&#8217;infrastruttura critica su cui poggia l&#8217;intero meccanismo E-Evidence. Senza un sistema affidabile, sicuro e interoperabile, anche le norme più sofisticate rimangono lettera morta.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;architettura del sistema si basa su un modello decentrato dove ogni Stato membro mantiene il proprio punto di accesso nazionale, interconnesso con gli altri punti di accesso attraverso una rete sicura. Questa scelta architettonica, preferita rispetto a un sistema centralizzato, risponde a multiple esigenze: sovranità nazionale, perché ogni Stato mantiene il controllo sul proprio nodo e sui dati che transitano; resilienza, perché il fallimento di un nodo non compromette l&#8217;intero sistema; scalabilità, perché nuovi Stati membri possono essere aggiunti senza riprogettare l&#8217;architettura complessiva. Il modello ricorda quello adottato per e-CODEX, il sistema utilizzato per lo scambio di informazioni giudiziarie in ambito civile, che ha dimostrato nel corso degli anni una buona tenuta operativa.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve garantire che il punto di accesso nazionale rispetti rigorosi requisiti di sicurezza che vanno ben oltre gli standard generici della <em>cybersecurity</em>. Tutte le comunicazioni devono essere cifrate utilizzando algoritmi crittografici conformi agli standard dell&#8217;ENISA e alle raccomandazioni dell&#8217;Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale. La gestione delle chiavi crittografiche deve seguire <em>best practice</em> consolidate: utilizzo di <em>Hardware Security Module</em> per la custodia delle chiavi private, rotazione periodica delle chiavi, segregazione rigorosa dei ruoli tra chi genera, chi custodisce e chi autorizza l&#8217;uso delle chiavi. L&#8217;autenticazione degli operatori deve basarsi su meccanismi multi-fattore, con certificati digitali rilasciati e gestiti secondo gli standard eIDAS che garantiscono l&#8217;identità digitale certificata degli operatori.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto cruciale per la <em>digital forensics</em> è la tracciabilità completa di ogni operazione sul sistema. Ogni emissione, ricezione, modifica, accesso ai dati deve essere tracciata in <em>log</em> immutabili con <em>timestamp</em> certificato. Questa tracciabilità non risponde solo a esigenze di sicurezza informatica ma è fondamentale per garantire la <em>chain of custody</em> digitale delle prove: in un eventuale processo, deve essere possibile ricostruire esattamente chi ha avuto accesso a quali dati, quando, da quale terminale, con quale autorizzazione. I <em>log</em> devono essere protetti contro manomissioni attraverso tecniche di firma digitale o <em>blockchain</em>, e conservati per periodi congrui che permettano verifiche <em>ex post</em>.</p>\n<p>La segregazione dei dati sensibili contenuti negli EPOC e nelle risposte deve essere implementata attraverso controlli di accesso granulari basati su <em>Role-Based Access Control</em>. Non basta un semplice sistema di permessi: ogni operatore deve avere accesso esclusivamente ai procedimenti per i quali è specificamente autorizzato, con meccanismi automatici che impediscano accessi non autorizzati anche accidentali. Il sistema deve inoltre garantire <em>availability</em> del 99,9%, il che significa al massimo circa otto ore di <em>downtime</em> all&#8217;anno. Considerando che gli EPOC in emergenza devono essere eseguiti entro otto ore, anche poche ore di interruzione del sistema potrebbero tradursi nella perdita di prove critiche. Questo richiede sistemi ridondanti, <em>backup</em> geograficamente distribuiti, procedure di <em>disaster recovery</em> testate periodicamente attraverso simulazioni realistiche.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;intero sistema deve essere progettato secondo i principi di <em>privacy by design</em> e <em>privacy by default</em>, con una <em>Data Protection Impact Assessment</em> obbligatoria che coinvolga attivamente il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali. Ma c&#8217;è un ulteriore livello di complessità: il punto di accesso nazionale non può essere un sistema isolato.</p>\n<p>Deve interfacciarsi con il sistema OEI nazionale per garantire coordinamento e complementarietà tra i due strumenti, evitando che gli investigatori si trovino a dover scegliere tra procedure diverse senza criteri chiari. Deve dialogare con il Sistema Informativo della Cognizione Penale per la gestione dei procedimenti penali, con i sistemi Eurojust e della rete giudiziaria europea per lo scambio di informazioni complementari, con il portale europeo e-Justice per l&#8217;accesso alle informazioni pubbliche sul sistema.</p>\n<p>Il rischio concreto è creare l&#8217;ennesimo sistema a sé stante, un&#8217;isola tecnologica che richiede <em>login</em> separati, interfacce diverse, flussi di lavoro ridondanti. L&#8217;integrazione con i sistemi esistenti è cruciale non solo per l&#8217;efficienza operativa ma anche per garantire che gli strumenti vengano effettivamente utilizzati dagli operatori sul campo. La legge di delegazione impone al Governo di provvedere all&#8217;adozione delle misure necessarie a garantire la piena funzionalità del sistema informatico nazionale, il che significa investimenti significativi non solo in <em>hardware</em> e <em>software</em> ma anche in formazione degli operatori. La <em>governance</em> del sistema dovrà coinvolgere Ministero della Giustizia, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale, AGID, con ruoli e responsabilità chiaramente definiti e meccanismi di coordinamento efficaci.</p>\n<h3>Procedure di riesame e tutela dei diritti: il difficile equilibrio</h3>\n<p>Uno degli aspetti più delicati del sistema E-Evidence, che solleva le maggiori perplessità tra i garantisti e gli esperti di diritti fondamentali, riguarda i meccanismi di riesame e tutela dei diritti. Il modello «orizzontale» che bypassa l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione rischia di indebolire le garanzie processuali se non viene adeguatamente bilanciato attraverso altri meccanismi di controllo. Il regolamento cerca questo equilibrio attraverso un sistema articolato di obiezioni, notifiche e ricorsi, ma l&#8217;efficacia concreta dipenderà dalle scelte implementative degli Stati membri.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 14 del regolamento prevede che i prestatori di servizi possano sollevare obiezioni motivate all&#8217;esecuzione di un EPOC in diverse circostanze: quando l&#8217;ordine non è stato emesso o convalidato da un&#8217;autorità competente secondo il regolamento; quando l&#8217;ordine è manifestamente al di fuori dell&#8217;ambito di applicazione del regolamento, ad esempio perché richiede dati per finalità non penali; quando l&#8217;ordine viola manifestamente la Carta dei diritti fondamentali dell&#8217;UE o è manifestamente arbitrario; quando esistono conflitti con obblighi previsti dalla legislazione di paesi terzi dove i dati sono fisicamente conservati.</p>\n<p>Quest&#8217;ultimo caso è particolarmente delicato: se un <em>provider</em> americano conserva dati su server negli Stati Uniti e riceve un EPOC che richiede quei dati, potrebbe trovarsi in conflitto tra gli obblighi europei e le disposizioni del CLOUD Act americano.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve individuare l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria competente per il riesame di queste obiezioni ai sensi dell&#8217;articolo 17 del regolamento. La scelta più logica appare essere il Tribunale del Riesame, già competente per questioni analoghe in ambito interno relative al sequestro e all&#8217;acquisizione di prove, ma il decreto potrebbe anche prevedere un giudice specializzato considerata la complessità tecnico-giuridica delle questioni. Un giudice chiamato a valutare un&#8217;obiezione basata su un conflitto con la legislazione di un paese terzo deve avere competenze che vanno oltre il tradizionale diritto processuale penale: deve comprendere i principi di diritto internazionale privato, le questioni di giurisdizione extraterritoriale, gli aspetti tecnici di localizzazione dei dati in architetture <em>cloud</em> distribuite.</p>\n<p>Parallelamente, l&#8217;articolo 15 del regolamento impone che la persona i cui dati sono stati richiesti sia informata della richiesta, salvo quando la notifica possa compromettere l&#8217;indagine. Il decreto deve definire con precisione le tempistiche per la notifica quando non differita, il contenuto dell&#8217;informativa specificando quali elementi devono essere comunicati, i meccanismi di ricorso effettivo dinanzi alle autorità giudiziarie dello Stato di emissione, le procedure per l&#8217;accesso, la rettifica e la cancellazione dei dati compatibilmente con le esigenze investigative.</p>\n<p>Questo diritto all&#8217;informazione è fondamentale perché permette alla persona interessata di attivarsi per la tutela dei propri diritti, ma al contempo può compromettere l&#8217;efficacia dell&#8217;indagine se esercitato prematuramente. Il bilanciamento tra questi interessi confliggenti richiede criteri oggettivi e verificabili, non rimessi alla mera discrezionalità dell&#8217;autorità inquirente.</p>\n<p>Un ultimo livello di garanzia è rappresentato dal sistema di notifica agli Stati membri previsto per i dati più invasivi. Per i dati relativi alle operazioni e ai contenuti, salvo casi specifici dove è evidente che il reato è stato commesso nel paese di emissione o la persona interessata risiede in quel territorio, lo Stato di emissione deve notificare l&#8217;EPOC allo Stato di esecuzione dove si trova lo stabilimento designato o il rappresentante legale del <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Lo Stato di esecuzione ha dieci giorni per sollevare eventuali motivi di rifiuto: immunità o privilegi secondo il proprio diritto, rischio per la sicurezza nazionale o per altri interessi essenziali, <em>ne bis in idem</em> se la persona è già stata giudicata per gli stessi fatti, conflitto con principi fondamentali del proprio ordinamento costituzionale. Questo meccanismo rappresenta un residuo di cooperazione «verticale» all&#8217;interno del modello orizzontale, una valvola di sicurezza per proteggere gli interessi fondamentali degli Stati membri. Il decreto italiano deve definire quale autorità nazionale gestisce queste notifiche in arrivo e valuta l&#8217;eventuale sollevazione di motivi di rifiuto, con procedure rapide che non vanifichino l&#8217;obiettivo di celerità del sistema ma che garantiscano al contempo una valutazione seria e approfondita.</p>\n<h3>L&#8217;obbligo di rappresentanza: ridisegnare la presenza dei <em>provider</em> nell&#8217;UE</h3>\n<p>La Direttiva UE 2023/1544, che l&#8217;Atto del Governo 330 deve recepire entro il 18 febbraio 2026, introduce un obbligo che può apparire tecnico ma che ha implicazioni profonde sul modo in cui i <em>provider</em> globali operano nel mercato europeo. I prestatori di servizi che offrono servizi nell&#8217;Unione Europea, anche se non fisicamente stabiliti sul territorio, devono designare uno «stabilimento designato» o nominare un «rappresentante legale» in almeno uno Stato membro dell&#8217;UE. Questa previsione ribalta il principio tradizionale per cui un&#8217;impresa non stabilita in un territorio non è soggetta alla giurisdizione di quel territorio: qui si impone un obbligo di presenza, sia pure attraverso un rappresentante, come condizione per operare nel mercato europeo.</p>\n<p>Il perimetro applicativo della direttiva è ampio. Rientrano nell&#8217;obbligo i fornitori di reti e servizi di comunicazione elettronica, dai tradizionali operatori telefonici ai <em>provider</em> di servizi internet, dai servizi VoIP come Skype o WhatsApp ai servizi di messaggistica istantanea. Sono inclusi i prestatori di servizi della società dell&#8217;informazione: <em>social media</em> come Facebook, Twitter, Instagram; piattaforme di <em>video-sharing</em> come YouTube o TikTok; servizi di <em>cloud storage</em> come Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive; <em>provider</em> di email come Gmail o Outlook.com; piattaforme e-commerce come Amazon o eBay. Infine, ricadono nell&#8217;obbligo i prestatori di servizi finanziari: banche <em>online</em>, servizi di pagamento elettronico come PayPal o Stripe, piattaforme di <em>trading</em>, servizi di <em>wallet</em> digitale per criptovalute.</p>\n<p>Le esclusioni sono significative e rispondono a logiche di proporzionalità. Sono esentate le micro-imprese con meno di dieci dipendenti e fatturato annuo inferiore a due milioni di euro, una soglia che esclude le <em>startup</em> in fase iniziale e i piccoli progetti ma che non offre riparo ai <em>player</em> consolidati.</p>\n<p>Sono esclusi i prestatori puramente nazionali che offrono servizi esclusivamente all&#8217;interno di un singolo Stato membro, anche se la verifica di questo requisito può essere complessa nell&#8217;era di internet dove anche un servizio pensato per un mercato locale può essere tecnicamente accessibile da qualsiasi parte del mondo. Infine, sono esclusi i servizi dove la conservazione dei dati è puramente accessoria rispetto all&#8217;attività principale, come nel caso di professionisti quali avvocati, architetti, ingegneri o contabili che forniscono servizi <em>online</em> ma la cui attività principale non è digitale.</p>\n<p>La sfida per il decreto italiano sarà applicare queste categorie a modelli di <em>business</em> ibridi o innovativi che non rientrano facilmente nelle classificazioni tradizionali. Un <em>influencer</em> con milioni di <em>follower</em> che monetizza contenuti attraverso una piattaforma proprietaria è un prestatore di servizi della società dell&#8217;informazione? Un&#8217;applicazione di <em>dating</em> con funzionalità di messaggistica integrata rientra nell&#8217;obbligo perché offre un servizio di comunicazione elettronica? Una piattaforma di <em>gaming online</em> con chat tra giocatori deve nominare un rappresentante legale? Il decreto dovrà fornire criteri interpretativi chiari, possibilmente attraverso esempi concreti o una casistica di riferimento, per evitare incertezze che potrebbero tradursi in contenziosi.</p>\n<h3>Rappresentante legale vs stabilimento designato: una scelta strategica</h3>\n<p>La direttiva lascia ai prestatori la scelta tra due modalità di adempimento dell&#8217;obbligo. Lo stabilimento designato è un&#8217;entità del <em>provider</em> già presente nell&#8217;UE – una filiale, una succursale, un ufficio – che viene formalmente designata come punto di contatto per ricevere e dare seguito agli ordini europei. Questa opzione presenta vantaggi in termini di integrazione con la struttura aziendale esistente e di accesso diretto ai sistemi e alle banche dati del <em>provider</em>, ma presuppone che il <em>provider</em> abbia già una presenza fisica significativa nell&#8217;UE, il che non è scontato per molti <em>player</em> extra-europei.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;alternativa è la nomina di un rappresentante legale, una persona fisica o giuridica distinta dal <em>provider</em> che viene incaricata di fungere da interfaccia. Può essere un grande studio legale specializzato in diritto digitale e cooperazione giudiziaria internazionale, un <em>service provider</em> dedicato che offre servizi di rappresentanza legale per conto di multipli clienti, un consulente esterno con le competenze necessarie. Questa opzione offre flessibilità ed è particolarmente adatta per <em>provider</em> extra-UE senza presenza fisica, ma solleva interrogativi sulla reale capacità del rappresentante di dare seguito agli ordini se non ha accesso diretto ai sistemi del <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Ed è proprio qui che la direttiva introduce una previsione cruciale: l&#8217;articolo 3, paragrafo 4, impone che il rappresentante legale o lo stabilimento designato abbiano «i poteri e le risorse necessari per ottemperare» agli ordini europei. Non si tratta quindi di una semplice nomina formale, di una casella postale o di un <em>front office</em> che inoltra le richieste alla casa madre. Il rappresentante deve avere accesso tecnico effettivo ai sistemi del <em>provider</em> per recuperare i dati richiesti, il che implica accordi contrattuali dettagliati, interfacce tecniche sicure, credenziali di accesso privilegiate.</p>\n<p>Deve disporre di competenza tecnico-legale, con personale esperto sia in <em>digital forensics</em> e <em>data management</em> che in diritto processuale penale e <em>data protection</em>. Deve avere capacità operativa H24/7 per gestire le richieste di emergenza che richiedono risposta entro otto ore, il che significa turni continui, reperibilità costante, processi organizzativi rodati e testati. Deve avere risorse finanziarie adeguate per sostenere i costi operativi non trascurabili di un sistema di questo tipo.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve chiarire gli standard minimi richiesti per considerare adeguati i poteri e le risorse del rappresentante. Un rappresentante legale che dichiara formalmente di avere i poteri necessari ma che nella pratica non riesce ad accedere ai dati o che impiega settimane per ottenere risposte dalla casa madre rende l&#8217;intero meccanismo inefficace. Potrebbe essere opportuno prevedere un sistema di accreditamento o certificazione dei rappresentanti legali, con verifiche periodiche della loro effettiva capacità operativa. D&#8217;altra parte, standard troppo stringenti potrebbero scoraggiare i <em>provider</em> dall&#8217;offrire servizi nel mercato europeo o spingere verso soluzioni di <em>compliance</em> meramente formali.</p>\n<h3>Responsabilità solidale: un meccanismo controverso ma necessario</h3>\n<p>Uno degli aspetti più discussi della direttiva è la previsione di responsabilità solidale tra il prestatore di servizi e il rappresentante legale o lo stabilimento designato per l&#8217;inottemperanza agli obblighi. L&#8217;articolo 3, paragrafo 5, stabilisce che entrambi possono essere ritenuti responsabili e che non può essere invocata «la mancanza di procedure interne adeguate» tra <em>provider</em> e rappresentante come giustificazione dell&#8217;inottemperanza. Questa previsione risponde a un&#8217;esigenza pratica comprensibile: evitare che <em>provider</em> e rappresentanti si «scarichino» reciprocamente la responsabilità, con il <em>provider</em> che sostiene di aver fornito tutti i dati al rappresentante e il rappresentante che afferma di non aver ricevuto collaborazione dal <em>provider</em>, mentre l&#8217;autorità inquirente rimane senza le prove necessarie.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, la responsabilità solidale solleva questioni complesse che il decreto italiano dovrà affrontare. Come si coordina questo meccanismo con i principi costituzionali di personalità della responsabilità penale e amministrativa? Se il rappresentante legale è uno studio legale esterno che ha adempiuto diligentemente ai propri obblighi contrattuali ma il <em>provider</em>, che ha sede in un paese extra-UE, si rifiuta di fornire i dati, è giusto sanzionare anche il rappresentante? Viceversa, se il <em>provider</em> ha fornito tempestivamente tutti i dati richiesti ma il rappresentante, per negligenza o incapacità organizzativa, non li trasmette all&#8217;autorità richiedente, il <em>provider</em> deve subire le conseguenze?</p>\n<p>La soluzione probabilmente risiede in una graduazione della responsabilità basata sull&#8217;effettivo controllo sulla situazione e sulla possibilità concreta di adempiere. Il rappresentante legale dovrebbe rispondere pienamente quando l&#8217;inottemperanza dipende da inefficienze nella sua organizzazione o da sua negligenza, ma dovrebbe avere la possibilità di dimostrare di aver fatto tutto il possibile per ottenere i dati dal <em>provider</em>. Simmetricamente, il <em>provider</em> dovrebbe rispondere pienamente quando si rifiuta di collaborare con il proprio rappresentante o quando le «procedure interne» sono volutamente farraginose per rendere difficile l&#8217;esecuzione degli ordini. La responsabilità dovrebbe essere effettivamente solidale solo quando entrambi hanno contribuito all&#8217;inottemperanza o quando non è possibile determinare dove risieda la responsabilità principale.</p>\n<p>Il regime sanzionatorio disegnato dal regolamento 2023/1543 prevede sanzioni pecuniarie fino al due per cento del fatturato mondiale annuo totale dell&#8217;esercizio precedente per i <em>provider</em> che non rispettano gli ordini europei, mentre la direttiva 2023/1544 richiede sanzioni «effettive, proporzionate e dissuasive» per la violazione degli obblighi di designazione o nomina e per l&#8217;inottemperanza. Per comprendere la portata di queste cifre, si consideri che per un gigante tecnologico come Meta il due per cento del fatturato mondiale può significare oltre due miliardi di dollari. Si tratta di sanzioni potenzialmente devastanti, pensate per essere realmente deterrenti anche per i <em>player</em> globali che potrebbero essere tentati di ignorare le richieste europee.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve definire diversi aspetti fondamentali di questo regime sanzionatorio. Innanzitutto, la natura delle sanzioni: saranno puramente amministrative o si configureranno reati in casi particolarmente gravi, ad esempio quando l&#8217;inottemperanza è dolosa e finalizzata a favorire attività criminali? In secondo luogo, l&#8217;autorità competente per l&#8217;irrogazione: il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali, che ha già esperienza con sanzioni significative in ambito GDPR? L&#8217;autorità giudiziaria che ha emesso l&#8217;EPOC non eseguito? Un&#8217;autorità amministrativa dedicata?</p>\n<p>La graduazione delle sanzioni dovrà tenere conto della gravità della violazione, distinguendo tra ritardi nella risposta e rifiuti espliciti, tra prime violazioni e comportamenti reiterati, tra situazioni di impossibilità oggettiva debitamente documentata e mancanza di collaborazione. Dovranno essere previste circostanze attenuanti per situazioni di reale impossibilità tecnica, per i casi di prima violazione quando seguita da immediata correzione, per i <em>provider</em> che dimostrano piena cooperazione anche se non riescono a fornire tutti i dati richiesti nei tempi previsti.</p>\n<p>Infine, e questo è cruciale per la legittimità del sistema, devono essere garantiti il diritto di difesa e meccanismi di ricorso effettivo. Un <em>provider</em> sanzionato deve avere la possibilità di contestare la sanzione dinanzi a un giudice indipendente, di dimostrare l&#8217;impossibilità di esecuzione, di fornire elementi a propria discolpa. Il rischio, altrimenti, è che sanzioni tanto elevate vengano considerate sproporzionate dalla giurisprudenza europea, rendendo l&#8217;intero sistema inefficace.</p>\n<h3>Impatto operativo: costi, opportunità e trasformazioni di mercato</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;implementazione del sistema E-Evidence comporta costi significativi per i prestatori di servizi che vanno ben oltre l&#8217;aspetto meramente finanziario, incidendo sull&#8217;organizzazione aziendale, sui processi operativi, sulle strategie di mercato. I costi di <em>setup</em> iniziale includono la nomina o designazione del rappresentante legale o stabilimento designato, con tutti gli adempimenti legali e contrattuali connessi. Occorre sviluppare interfacce tecniche con il sistema informatico decentrato, il che significa progetti di integrazione <em>software</em> complessi che devono garantire sicurezza, affidabilità e conformità agli standard europei.</p>\n<p>I sistemi interni di <em>data retention</em> e <em>retrieval</em> devono essere adeguati per permettere l&#8217;estrazione rapida ed efficiente dei dati nelle categorie previste dal regolamento, con particolare attenzione alla capacità di rispettare i tempi stringenti di otto ore per le emergenze. Il personale deve essere formato non solo sugli aspetti tecnici ma anche su quelli giuridici, perché chi gestisce le richieste deve essere in grado di comprendere le implicazioni legali di ogni categoria di dati e di valutare la legittimità formale degli ordini ricevuti.</p>\n<p>I costi ricorrenti sono altrettanto rilevanti. Ogni richiesta richiede analisi legale per verificare la conformità formale dell&#8217;ordine, estrazione tecnica dei dati che può essere semplice per i <em>subscriber data</em> ma estremamente complessa per ricostruzioni di dati storici o per dati conservati in architetture distribuite, preparazione delle risposte in formati strutturati e sicuri. Il mantenimento della disponibilità H24/7 implica costi di personale significativi, con turni di reperibilità e procedure di escalation. Gli aggiornamenti tecnici e normativi sono continui in un settore in rapidissima evoluzione, e il sistema deve essere costantemente adeguato. Infine, le attività di <em>auditing</em> e <em>compliance</em> per dimostrare la conformità agli obblighi richiedono risorse dedicate.</p>\n<p>Per i grandi <em>provider</em> questi costi sono sostenibili e probabilmente già parzialmente ammortizzati attraverso le strutture esistenti per gestire richieste di autorità nazionali attraverso canali tradizionali. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon hanno già team dedicati alla <em>law enforcement compliance</em> con processi consolidati, anche se dovranno adeguarli alle specificità del sistema E-Evidence. Per <em>provider</em> medio-piccoli, invece, questi costi possono rappresentare una barriera significativa che potrebbe scoraggiarli dall&#8217;offrire servizi nel mercato europeo o spingerli verso modelli di <em>business</em> che eludono formalmente l&#8217;applicazione della direttiva. Il rischio concreto è un effetto di concentrazione di mercato, dove i <em>player</em> dominanti vengono ulteriormente rafforzati perché hanno le risorse per gestire la <em>compliance</em> mentre i concorrenti più piccoli vengono marginalizzati.</p>\n<p>Questo scenario potrebbe però aprire opportunità di <em>business</em> interessanti. Si sta già sviluppando un mercato di «E-Evidence <em>Compliance as a Service</em>», con società specializzate che offrono servizi di rappresentanza legale e gestione delle richieste per conto di multiple <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Il modello è simile a quello dei <em>Data Protection Officer as a Service</em> emerso con il GDPR: un <em>provider</em> specializzato che mette a disposizione le competenze, le infrastrutture, i processi necessari serve multiple clienti, distribuendo i costi fissi e rendendo la <em>compliance</em> accessibile anche a realtà più piccole.</p>\n<p>Questo modello potrebbe abbassare significativamente le barriere all&#8217;ingresso, ma solleva questioni di qualità del servizio e di tutela dei dati, perché i <em>provider</em> delegano al fornitore esterno l&#8217;accesso a dati potenzialmente molto sensibili dei propri utenti.</p>\n<h2><em>Digital forensics</em> transfrontaliera: l&#8217;anello critico della catena probatoria</h2>\n<h3><em>Chain of custody</em> in ambiente transfrontaliero: preservare l&#8217;integrità attraverso i confini</h3>\n<p>Quando parliamo di prove digitali acquisite attraverso un EPOC, uno degli aspetti più critici da un punto di vista forense è la preservazione della <em>chain of custody</em> attraverso passaggi multipli e giurisdizioni diverse. In ambito nazionale, la catena di custodia delle prove digitali segue protocolli consolidati: dal momento del sequestro o dell&#8217;acquisizione, ogni passaggio deve essere documentato, ogni persona che ha avuto accesso ai dati deve essere identificata, ogni operazione sui dati deve essere tracciata, ogni trasferimento deve essere accompagnato da verbali di consegna. Gli standard internazionali come l&#8217;ISO/IEC 27037 forniscono linee guida dettagliate per l&#8217;identificazione, la raccolta, l&#8217;acquisizione e la preservazione di prove digitali.</p>\n<p>Il sistema E-Evidence introduce una complessità aggiuntiva perché la prova digitale attraversa confini giurisdizionali senza che l&#8217;autorità richiedente abbia controllo diretto sul processo di estrazione. I dati vengono estratti dai sistemi del <em>provider</em>, nello Stato di esecuzione, da personale del <em>provider</em> o del rappresentante legale che opera secondo procedure proprie, possibilmente diverse da quelle dello Stato richiedente. I dati vengono quindi trasmessi attraverso il sistema informatico decentrato, subendo processi di crittografia, trasferimento su reti, decrittografia. Infine, arrivano all&#8217;autorità richiedente che deve verificarne l&#8217;autenticità e l&#8217;integrità prima di utilizzarli nel procedimento.</p>\n<p>Come garantire che in questo processo articolato le prove mantengano le caratteristiche di genuinità, autenticità e integrità richieste per la loro utilizzabilità processuale? La risposta risiede in una combinazione di misure tecniche e procedurali.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista tecnico, l&#8217;utilizzo di funzioni di <em>hash</em> crittografiche come SHA-256 o SHA-3 permette di generare un&#8217;impronta digitale univoca dei dati al momento dell&#8217;estrazione. Questa impronta viene allegata ai dati trasmessi e l&#8217;autorità ricevente può ricalcolarla sui dati ricevuti: se le due impronte coincidono, è matematicamente certo che i dati non sono stati alterati durante la trasmissione. Il <em>timestamping</em> certificato, basato su servizi di <em>timestamping</em> qualificati ai sensi del regolamento eIDAS, permette di provare che i dati esistevano in una certa forma in un momento specifico, rendendo impossibile retrodatazioni o modifiche.</p>\n<p>I <em>metadata</em> originali dei file devono essere preservati integralmente perché possono contenere informazioni forensi cruciali: data e ora di creazione, data e ora di ultima modifica, autore del documento, versioni precedenti, dati EXIF per le immagini che includono informazioni sulla fotocamera e sulla geolocalizzazione. Il formato di trasmissione deve essere <em>forense-friendly</em>, preferibilmente formati aperti e documentati che permettano verifiche indipendenti. Le firme digitali apposte dal sistema informatico decentrato ad ogni passaggio creano una catena di autenticazione verificabile.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista procedurale, è fondamentale che ogni attore della catena documenti dettagliatamente le proprie operazioni. Il <em>provider</em> o il rappresentante legale che estrae i dati deve generare un <em>report</em> tecnico che descriva: quali sistemi sono stati interrogati, quali <em>query</em> sono state eseguite, in quale formato sono stati estratti i dati, quali <em>hash</em> sono stati calcolati, chi ha effettuato materialmente l&#8217;estrazione, quando è avvenuta l&#8217;operazione. Il sistema informatico decentrato deve generare <em>log</em> completi che documentino ogni passaggio della trasmissione. L&#8217;autorità ricevente deve verificare formalmente l&#8217;integrità dei dati ricevuti ricalcolando gli <em>hash</em>, controllando le firme digitali, validando i <em>timestamp</em>, e deve documentare queste verifiche in un verbale che entrerà a far parte del fascicolo processuale.</p>\n<p>La sfida è standardizzare queste procedure tra Stati membri con tradizioni processuali diverse. Un investigatore italiano deve poter fidarsi che i dati estratti da un <em>provider</em> secondo le procedure tedesche o francesi o svedesi rispettino standard forensi equivalenti a quelli italiani. Questo richiede un lavoro di armonizzazione che va oltre le norme giuridiche e coinvolge le <em>best practice</em> tecniche, la formazione degli operatori, la certificazione dei processi.</p>\n<h3>I tempi di risposta come variabile critica: tra efficienza e qualità</h3>\n<p>Il regolamento stabilisce tempi di risposta stringenti: dieci giorni per un EPOC standard, riducibili a otto ore in caso di emergenza debitamente accertata. Questi tempi rappresentano un drammatico miglioramento rispetto ai mesi necessari per le rogatorie tradizionali o alle settimane dell&#8217;OEI, ma introducono tensioni con le esigenze di accuratezza e completezza proprie della <em>digital forensics</em>. Un&#8217;estrazione di dati frettolosa, eseguita sotto la pressione di una scadenza di otto ore, può comportare errori, omissioni, perdita di <em>metadata</em>, contaminazione di prove.</p>\n<p>Le otto ore per le emergenze sono pensate per situazioni dove il pericolo di perdita delle prove è imminente: un sospetto di terrorismo che potrebbe rendersi conto di essere sotto investigazione e cancellare tutti i suoi <em>account</em>; una vittima di sequestro di persona dove le comunicazioni del sequestratore potrebbero fornire indizi sulla localizzazione; un attacco informatico in corso dove i <em>log</em> potrebbero essere cancellati. In questi casi, la velocità è effettivamente prioritaria rispetto alla perfezione forense, secondo il principio che una prova imperfetta è meglio di nessuna prova. Ma questa logica non può essere estesa indiscriminatamente: l&#8217;emergenza deve essere reale, documentata, verificabile <em>ex post</em>.</p>\n<p>I dieci giorni per le richieste standard rappresentano un compromesso più ragionevole che dovrebbe permettere estrazioni accurate, ma anche qui ci sono criticità. Per dati semplici come <em>subscriber data</em> o <em>access data</em> limitati nel tempo, dieci giorni sono abbondanti.</p>\n<p>Ma se l&#8217;EPOC richiede, ad esempio, tutti i contenuti di un <em>account</em> email attivo da anni con decine di migliaia di messaggi, o tutti i file conservati in un <em>account</em> di <em>cloud storage</em> che contiene terabyte di dati, o una ricostruzione completa delle comunicazioni di un utente su un <em>social network</em> nell&#8217;arco di mesi, dieci giorni possono essere insufficienti per un&#8217;estrazione completa e accurata. Il regolamento prevede la possibilità per il <em>provider</em> di chiedere una proroga in casi di impossibilità tecnica, ma questa deve essere motivata e documentata, e non è detto che venga concessa.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto spesso sottovalutato riguarda la qualità dei dati ricevuti. Non basta che il <em>provider</em> trasmetta dei dati entro i termini: i dati devono essere completi, accurati, utilizzabili. Se arrivano dati parziali, o in formati proprietari non facilmente analizzabili, o senza adeguata documentazione tecnica che permetta di interpretarli correttamente, l&#8217;utilità investigativa è compromessa.</p>\n<p>Il regolamento non specifica in dettaglio i requisiti tecnici per il formato di trasmissione dei dati, rimandando a standard che dovranno essere sviluppati nell&#8217;ambito del sistema informatico decentrato. Questa standardizzazione è cruciale: un investigatore che riceve un file di <em>log</em> di accesso deve sapere come interpretare ogni campo, quale <em>timezone</em> sia utilizzato per i <em>timestamp</em>, come siano codificati gli indirizzi IP se compressi, quale sia il significato di eventuali <em>flag</em> o codici.</p>\n<h3>Competenze richieste: oltre il tradizionale perito informatico</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;utilizzo efficace del sistema E-Evidence richiede competenze che vanno ben oltre quelle del tradizionale investigatore o del perito informatico. Gli organi investigativi devono sviluppare capacità di formulare richieste tecnicamente precise, il che significa comprendere a fondo la distinzione tra le diverse categorie di dati e le loro implicazioni. Non è più sufficiente chiedere genericamente «tutti i dati relativi all&#8217;utente X»: bisogna specificare se si richiedono <em>subscriber data</em>, <em>access data</em>, <em>transactional data</em>, <em>content data</em>, e per ciascuna categoria quali elementi specifici sono rilevanti per l&#8217;indagine.</p>\n<p>Un investigatore che sta seguendo un caso di frode <em>online</em> potrebbe aver bisogno dei <em>subscriber data</em> per identificare il titolare dell&#8217;<em>account</em>, degli <em>access data</em> per determinare da dove e quando l&#8217;<em>account</em> è stato utilizzato, dei <em>transactional data</em> per ricostruire le comunicazioni con le vittime, dei <em>content data</em> per acquisire i messaggi in cui è stata perfezionata la truffa. Ma deve sapere che richiedere i <em>content data</em> comporta un livello di tutela più elevato, tempi potenzialmente più lunghi, maggiori possibilità di obiezioni. Deve valutare se i <em>transactional data</em>, che possono già rivelare molto sulla rete di contatti, siano sufficienti per quella fase dell&#8217;indagine, lasciando eventualmente i <em>content data</em> a una richiesta successiva quando ci saranno elementi più solidi.</p>\n<p>La competenza tecnica deve estendersi alla comprensione delle architetture dei servizi investigati. I dati su un servizio di email tradizionale sono strutturati diversamente da quelli su un servizio di messaggistica <em>end-to-end encrypted</em>.</p>\n<p>Un <em>social network</em> organizza i dati in modi che riflettono la sua particolare architettura: post pubblici, post condivisi con gruppi specifici, messaggi privati, reazioni, commenti, <em>metadata</em> di geolocalizzazione, connessioni tra utenti. Un servizio di <em>cloud storage</em> può conservare non solo i file attuali ma anche versioni precedenti, file cancellati ancora presenti in cestini o <em>backup</em>, <em>metadata</em> di condivisione. Richiedere «tutti i dati» senza specificare può portare a ricevere una massa enorme di informazioni difficile da analizzare, oppure a ricevere solo una parte dei dati effettivamente rilevanti perché il <em>provider</em> interpreta la richiesta in senso restrittivo.</p>\n<p>Questa complessità implica necessità formative significative. Gli investigatori devono essere formati non solo sugli aspetti giuridici del sistema E-Evidence ma anche sugli aspetti tecnici dei servizi digitali più comuni. I magistrati che devono convalidare gli EPOC o valutare le obiezioni dei <em>provider</em> devono avere competenze che vanno oltre il diritto processuale penale tradizionale, includendo elementi di diritto digitale, <em>data protection</em>, giurisdizione internazionale, tecnologie informatiche. I periti e i consulenti tecnici che analizzano i dati ricevuti devono avere familiarità con i formati di <em>export</em> dei principali <em>provider</em> e con le tecniche di analisi forense di grandi volumi di dati digitali.</p>\n<h3>E-Evidence e OEI: complementarietà o sovrapposizione?</h3>\n<p>Una delle questioni operative più delicate riguarda il rapporto tra il sistema E-Evidence e l&#8217;Ordine Europeo di Indagine. Entrambi gli strumenti sono destinati a coesistere, ma con ambiti di applicazione e logiche diverse che possono creare confusione negli operatori. L&#8217;OEI è uno strumento generalista che copre qualsiasi atto di indagine penale in ambito transfrontaliero: intercettazioni in tempo reale, perquisizioni e sequestri, assunzioni di testimoni, accertamenti tecnici, e ovviamente anche l&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali. Il sistema E-Evidence è invece uno strumento specialistico focalizzato esclusivamente sull&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali già conservate dai <em>provider</em> di servizi.</p>\n<p>La logica dell&#8217;OEI rimane quella della cooperazione verticale tra autorità giudiziarie: l&#8217;autorità di emissione invia l&#8217;OEI all&#8217;autorità di esecuzione che lo esegue secondo le proprie procedure nazionali. Questo significa che l&#8217;autorità di esecuzione mantiene un controllo sull&#8217;esecuzione dell&#8217;atto investigativo, può sollevare motivi di rifiuto, può ricorrere a atti di indagine diversi da quello richiesto se permettono di ottenere lo stesso risultato con mezzi meno intrusivi. Il sistema E-Evidence introduce invece la cooperazione orizzontale dove l&#8217;autorità richiedente si rivolge direttamente al <em>provider</em>, bypassando l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione salvo il meccanismo di notifica per i dati più invasivi.</p>\n<p>In teoria, la scelta tra i due strumenti dovrebbe basarsi sulla natura dell&#8217;atto investigativo richiesto. Se si tratta di acquisire prove digitali già conservate da un <em>provider</em> che ha uno stabilimento designato o un rappresentante legale nell&#8217;UE, lo strumento appropriato è l&#8217;EPOC. Se invece l&#8217;atto investigativo richiede un&#8217;attività materiale sul territorio dello Stato di esecuzione – una perquisizione di locali fisici, un sequestro di dispositivi <em>hardware</em>, un&#8217;intercettazione in tempo reale di comunicazioni – lo strumento appropriato rimane l&#8217;OEI. Se l&#8217;obiettivo è acquisire prove digitali da un soggetto che non è un <em>provider</em> di servizi rientrante nell&#8217;ambito della direttiva 2023/1544 – ad esempio, acquisire i dispositivi informatici di un&#8217;azienda sospettata di frode – l&#8217;OEI rimane lo strumento necessario.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, nella pratica le situazioni possono essere più ambigue. Si consideri il caso di un&#8217;indagine su un reato commesso utilizzando un servizio di <em>cloud storage</em>. L&#8217;investigatore potrebbe voler acquisire sia i file conservati sul <em>cloud</em> (accessibili tramite EPOC) sia il dispositivo fisico da cui l&#8217;utente accedeva al servizio (che richiederebbe un OEI per la perquisizione e il sequestro nello Stato dove si trova il dispositivo). Oppure un&#8217;indagine su traffico di stupefacenti potrebbe richiedere sia i messaggi scambiati su un&#8217;<em>app</em> di messaggistica (EPOC) sia le intercettazioni in tempo reale delle comunicazioni future (OEI). La complementarietà dei due strumenti richiede coordinamento: l&#8217;autorità inquirente deve sviluppare strategie investigative integrate che utilizzino entrambi gli strumenti in modo sinergico.</p>\n<p>C&#8217;è poi una zona grigia rappresentata dai casi in cui sarebbe tecnicamente possibile utilizzare entrambi gli strumenti. Se un&#8217;autorità italiana vuole acquisire i contenuti dell&#8217;<em>account</em> email di un indagato, e l&#8217;email <em>provider</em> ha un rappresentante legale in Germania, può emettere un EPOC indirizzato direttamente al rappresentante legale.</p>\n<p>Ma potrebbe anche, in teoria, emettere un OEI verso l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria tedesca chiedendo di acquisire quegli stessi dati. Quale strumento dovrebbe essere preferito? La logica del sistema E-Evidence suggerisce che, quando applicabile, l&#8217;EPOC dovrebbe essere lo strumento primario perché più rapido ed efficiente. Ma ci potrebbero essere situazioni in cui l&#8217;autorità richiedente preferisce passare attraverso l&#8217;OEI perché ritiene importante il controllo dell&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione, ad esempio in casi particolarmente delicati o controversi.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano dovrebbe fornire linee guida operative su questi aspetti, possibilmente attraverso circolari interpretative o manuali operativi destinati ai pubblici ministeri e agli investigatori. Dovrebbe chiarire che il sistema E-Evidence non sostituisce l&#8217;OEI ma lo affianca per una categoria specifica di prove, che la scelta tra i due strumenti deve basarsi sulla natura dell&#8217;atto investigativo e sul soggetto da cui si vogliono acquisire le prove, che in situazioni complesse è possibile e anzi auspicabile utilizzare entrambi gli strumenti in modo coordinato.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto procedurale importante riguarda la gestione dei casi in cui un EPOC non produce i risultati attesi: se il <em>provider</em> non è in grado di fornire i dati richiesti, o se fornisce dati parziali o inadeguati, l&#8217;autorità richiedente può «convertire» la richiesta in un OEI rivolgendosi all&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione per un&#8217;azione più invasiva? Il coordinamento tra i due sistemi deve essere fluido per evitare che le inefficienze di uno strumento non possano essere compensate dall&#8217;altro.</p>\n<h2><em>Privacy</em>, GDPR e proporzionalità: il bilanciamento necessario</h2>\n<p>Il rapporto tra il sistema E-Evidence e il Regolamento Generale sulla Protezione dei Dati è uno dei nodi più delicati e potenzialmente conflittuali dell&#8217;intera architettura normativa. Il regolamento 2023/1543 non deroga al GDPR ma stabilisce una base giuridica specifica per il trattamento dei dati personali nell&#8217;ambito dei procedimenti penali, richiamando l&#8217;articolo 23 del GDPR che permette limitazioni dei diritti degli interessati quando necessarie per la prevenzione, l&#8217;indagine e il perseguimento di reati. Tuttavia, anche quando opera questa base giuridica, rimangono fermi i principi fondamentali della protezione dati: necessità, proporzionalità, finalità limitata, minimizzazione dei dati, conservazione limitata nel tempo.</p>\n<p>Ogni EPOC deve rispettare il principio di necessità, nel senso che i dati richiesti devono essere effettivamente necessari per l&#8217;indagine in corso e non acquisibili con mezzi meno invasivi.</p>\n<p>Non è legittimo richiedere «tutti i dati» disponibili su un <em>account</em> per poi selezionare <em>a posteriori</em> quelli rilevanti: la richiesta deve essere specifica e mirata. Il principio di proporzionalità richiede che l&#8217;invasività della richiesta sia bilanciata con la gravità del reato investigato. Il regolamento stesso incorpora questo principio prevedendo che gli EPOC per i dati più invasivi (<em>transactional</em> e <em>content data</em>) possano essere emessi solo per reati punibili con pena detentiva massima di almeno tre anni, o per specifici reati informatici, di terrorismo o contro la sicurezza cibernetica indipendentemente dalla pena prevista.</p>\n<p>Il principio di finalità limitata impone che i dati acquisiti tramite EPOC possano essere utilizzati esclusivamente per il procedimento penale per cui sono stati richiesti, e non per altri scopi. Se durante l&#8217;analisi dei dati emergono indizi di reati diversi da quello per cui è stato emesso l&#8217;EPOC, la loro utilizzabilità come prova per questi altri reati è questione delicata che richiederà l&#8217;intervento della giurisprudenza. In ambito nazionale, la Corte di Cassazione ha elaborato la dottrina delle «scoperte fortuite» nel contesto delle intercettazioni, ma l&#8217;applicazione di questi principi ai dati acquisiti tramite EPOC presenta specificità che dovranno essere chiarite.</p>\n<p>La minimizzazione dei dati richiede che vengano acquisiti solo i dati strettamente necessari. Se è sufficiente conoscere con chi un indagato ha comunicato e quando (<em>transactional data</em>), non è proporzionato richiedere anche il contenuto delle comunicazioni. Se è sufficiente sapere da quale indirizzo IP un <em>account</em> è stato utilizzato (<em>access data</em>), non è necessario richiedere tutti i file conservati nell&#8217;<em>account</em>. Questo principio pone oneri significativi sulle autorità richiedenti che devono formulare richieste precise e giustificate, ma anche sui <em>provider</em> che dovrebbero avere la capacità tecnica di estrarre selettivamente solo i dati richiesti senza fornire automaticamente insiemi di dati più ampi.</p>\n<p>Il diritto all&#8217;informazione dell&#8217;interessato, previsto dall&#8217;articolo 15 del regolamento E-Evidence, deve essere effettivo e non meramente formale. La persona deve essere informata in termini comprensibili di quali dati sono stati acquisiti, per quale procedimento, con quale base giuridica, con quali diritti di ricorso. L&#8217;informazione può essere differita quando potrebbe pregiudicare l&#8217;indagine, ma non può essere negata indefinitamente. Il decreto italiano deve stabilire criteri oggettivi per decidere quando differire l&#8217;informazione e per quanto tempo, evitando che il differimento diventi la regola piuttosto che l&#8217;eccezione.</p>\n<p>I diritti di accesso, rettifica e cancellazione dell&#8217;interessato, previsti dal GDPR, devono essere compatibilizzati con le esigenze investigative. Un indagato ha diritto di accedere ai propri dati acquisiti dall&#8217;autorità inquirente? In linea generale, questo diritto si realizza attraverso il diritto di accesso agli atti del procedimento secondo le norme processuali penali, non attraverso i meccanismi del GDPR.</p>\n<p>Ma ci possono essere fasi in cui l&#8217;interessato non è ancora formalmente indagato e quindi non ha accesso agli atti: in questi casi, il GDPR potrebbe offrire tutele aggiuntive. Il diritto alla cancellazione è particolarmente problematico: non può essere invocato per cancellare prove di reato, ma potrebbe applicarsi a dati non rilevanti che sono stati acquisiti ma non sono utilizzati nel procedimento. Il decreto dovrebbe prevedere procedure di revisione periodica dei dati conservati per cancellare quelli non più necessari.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive critiche e rischi sistemici</h2>\n<p>Sarebbe ingenuo pensare che il sistema E-Evidence risolverà magicamente tutti i problemi dell&#8217;acquisizione transfrontaliera di prove digitali. Diverse questioni strutturali rimangono aperte e potrebbero minare l&#8217;efficacia del sistema o generare conseguenze indesiderate.</p>\n<p>La prima incognita riguarda l&#8217;effettiva volontà di <em>compliance</em> dei <em>provider</em>, specialmente quelli extra-europei. I giganti tecnologici americani hanno già team dedicati alla <em>law enforcement compliance</em> e probabilmente si adegueranno, anche se non senza tensioni politiche. Ma <em>provider</em> cinesi, russi, o di altre giurisdizioni con cui l&#8217;UE ha rapporti difficili, potrebbero essere meno cooperativi. Un <em>provider</em> che decide di non nominare un rappresentante legale nell&#8217;UE tecnicamente viola la direttiva e dovrebbe essere sanzionato, ma come imporre concretamente la sanzione a un&#8217;entità che non ha presenza fisica nell&#8217;UE e che potrebbe semplicemente ignorare le richieste europee? L&#8217;unica leva reale sarebbe il <em>blocking</em> del servizio, ma questo solleva questioni di proporzionalità e di impatto sugli utenti europei che utilizzano legittimamente quel servizio.</p>\n<p>La frammentazione geografica dei dati pone sfide tecniche e giuridiche. Molti <em>provider</em> globali utilizzano architetture <em>cloud</em> distribuite dove i dati degli utenti sono replicati su server in diverse giurisdizioni per ragioni di <em>performance</em> e affidabilità. Un utente italiano che utilizza un servizio americano potrebbe avere i propri dati conservati contemporaneamente su server in Irlanda, negli Stati Uniti, a Singapore. Quale copia dei dati viene fornita in risposta a un EPOC? Cosa succede se le diverse copie non sono perfettamente sincronizzate? Il <em>provider</em> è tenuto a fornire tutte le copie o solo una? E se diverse giurisdizioni reclamano obblighi contrastanti su quegli stessi dati?</p>\n<p>Il rischio di <em>weaponization</em> politica del sistema E-Evidence è concreto. Stati membri con standard democratici indeboliti potrebbero utilizzare gli EPOC per perseguire oppositori politici, giornalisti, attivisti. Il sistema di garanzie previsto dal regolamento dovrebbe proteggere contro questi abusi, ma la storia insegna che le garanzie formali non sempre sono sufficienti quando manca la volontà politica di applicarle. I <em>provider</em> potrebbero trovarsi nella difficile posizione di dover valutare se un EPOC formalmente legittimo nasconda in realtà un abuso politico, una valutazione che richiede giudizi delicati su sistemi giuridici stranieri.</p>\n<p>La standardizzazione tecnica tra Stati membri richiederà tempo e investimenti che non tutti i paesi sono egualmente preparati a sostenere. Il rischio è che il sistema funzioni efficacemente tra un nucleo di Stati con infrastrutture avanzate e competenze consolidate, mentre altri Stati rimangano ai margini. Questo potrebbe creare una cooperazione giudiziaria a più velocità, dove gli Stati tecnologicamente avanzati cooperano efficacemente tra loro attraverso E-Evidence mentre gli altri rimangono ancorati a strumenti tradizionali più lenti.</p>\n<p>La pressione sui tempi di risposta potrebbe compromettere la qualità delle prove. L&#8217;enfasi sulla velocità, comprensibile date le esigenze investigative, potrebbe creare incentivi perversi a sacrificare accuratezza e completezza sull&#8217;altare dell&#8217;efficienza. Un&#8217;estrazione frettolosa eseguita per rispettare il termine di otto ore potrebbe perdere <em>metadata</em> cruciali, omettere dati rilevanti, o introdurre errori che compromettono l&#8217;utilizzabilità processuale. Serve un bilanciamento delicato, e la cultura forense deve evolversi per incorporare protocolli di qualità anche in contesti di emergenza.</p>\n<h4>Conclusioni: verso un ecosistema investigativo maturo</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;attuazione del pacchetto E-Evidence attraverso gli schemi di decreto legislativo attualmente all&#8217;esame parlamentare rappresenta un passaggio epocale per il diritto processuale penale europeo e italiano. Non si tratta di una semplice aggiunta di strumenti tecnici alla cassetta degli attrezzi investigativi, ma di un ripensamento profondo di come lo Stato esercita la giurisdizione penale in un mondo digitalizzato dove i confini territoriali hanno perso gran parte del loro significato pratico.</p>\n<p>Per gli operatori del diritto, questo significa acquisire competenze nuove che incrociano diritto processuale, <em>data protection</em>, tecnologie informatiche, cooperazione internazionale. Per le forze di <em>law enforcement</em>, significa riorganizzare processi investigativi consolidati, formare personale specializzato, investire in infrastrutture tecnologiche. Per i CISO e i professionisti della <em>cybersecurity</em> dei <em>provider</em>, significa costruire processi di <em>compliance</em> complessi che bilanciano obblighi legali, tutela della <em>privacy</em> degli utenti, efficienza operativa, rischi reputazionali. Per gli esperti di <em>digital forensics</em>, significa sviluppare metodologie che funzionino in contesti transfrontalieri dove il controllo diretto sull&#8217;acquisizione delle prove è limitato.</p>\n<p>Ma soprattutto, per tutti gli attori dell&#8217;ecosistema, significa mantenere alta la vigilanza sui diritti fondamentali. L&#8217;efficienza investigativa è un valore importante in una società che deve proteggersi dalla criminalità, sempre più organizzata su scala transnazionale e sempre più sofisticata nell&#8217;uso delle tecnologie. Ma questa efficienza non può mai tradursi in un sacrificio ingiustificato della <em>privacy</em>, della libertà di espressione, del diritto alla difesa, delle garanzie processuali che definiscono una democrazia liberale. Il sistema E-Evidence funzionerà veramente solo se saprà essere al contempo efficace nel dare alle autorità gli strumenti per investigare e garantista nel proteggere i diritti delle persone.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Italia ha l&#8217;opportunità, attraverso gli schemi di decreto attualmente in discussione, di contribuire a costruire un sistema che sia modello di questo equilibrio. Le scelte implementative che verranno fatte nelle prossime settimane e mesi – quali autorità designare, come strutturare i processi di riesame, quali standard di sicurezza imporre al sistema informatico, come graduare le sanzioni, come formare gli operatori – determineranno se il sistema E-Evidence italiano sarà un esempio di cooperazione giudiziaria efficace e rispettosa dei diritti, o se si rivelerà un&#8217;altra occasione mancata.</p>\n<p>Il dibattito tecnico e politico che accompagna l&#8217;esame parlamentare degli schemi di decreto deve essere all&#8217;altezza della posta in gioco. Non può limitarsi a questioni formali di conformità alle norme europee, ma deve affrontare le questioni sostanziali di come vogliamo che la giustizia penale funzioni nell&#8217;era digitale, di quali garanzie consideriamo irrinunciabili, di come bilanciare esigenze investigative e tutela dei diritti, di come costruire fiducia reciproca tra Stati membri e tra Stati e cittadini. Ridefinire il rapporto tra giustizia penale e spazio digitale nell&#8217;Europa del ventunesimo secolo è la sfida che ci troviamo di fronte. Gli strumenti normativi ci sono, l&#8217;infrastruttura tecnica si sta costruendo. Ora serve la saggezza di usarli bene.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Vengono esaminati casi di studio, framework istituzionali e prospettive future per una forensica digitale più spiegabile, equa e affidabile.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nella <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/framework-dellanalisi-digitale-forense/\">forensica digitale</a> rappresenta una trasformazione paradigmatica nell&#8217;investigazione dei crimini informatici. Questo studio analizza criticamente l&#8217;applicazione di machine learning alle indagini forensi, esaminando algoritmi investigativi attraverso evidenze empiriche, case study internazionali e framework istituzionali. L&#8217;analisi si concentra sulle implicazioni operative degli algoritmi di deep learning per l&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali, sulle criticità dell&#8217;ammissibilità probatoria e sulle sfide dell&#8217;explainable AI nel contesto legale. La ricerca evidenzia come l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nell&#8217;analisi forense abbia permesso <a href=\"https://www.amresearchreview.com/index.php/Journal/article/view/49\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>riduzioni del 57%</strong></a><strong> nei tempi di analisi</strong>, pur sollevando questioni fondamentali sulla trasparenza algoritmica e sui bias computazionali. Attraverso l&#8217;esame di metodologie <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/publications/strategic-opportunities-advance-forensic-science-united-states-path-forward-through\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NIST</a> ed <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2024-2026-condensed-version\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ENISA</a>, vengono delineate raccomandazioni operative evidence-based per implementazioni responsabili dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nelle investigazioni sui crimini informatici.</p>\n<h2>Introduzione e quadro teorico: l&#8217;evoluzione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nelle investigazioni digitali</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;esplosione del volume di dati digitali e la crescente sofisticazione delle minacce informatiche hanno reso le metodologie forensi tradizionali progressivamente inadeguate. La crescita esponenziale del volume di prove digitali, mentre le capacità analitiche manuali degli investigatori sono rimaste sostanzialmente invariate, ha creato un divario investigativo senza precedenti. Questo gap ha catalizzato l&#8217;adozione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale come risposta sistemica a una sfida investigativa di portata globale.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;integrazione di machine learning nelle indagini forensi rappresenta un vero cambio di paradigma metodologico. Secondo lo <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281723001944\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">studio di Dipo Dunsin</a> et al. <em>A comprehensive analysis of the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in modern digital forensics and incident response</em> (2024) pubblicato su <em>Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation</em>, l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale amplifica l&#8217;efficienza investigativa grazie alla capacità di elaborare dataset complessi, identificare pattern nascosti e automatizzare processi ripetitivi. Tuttavia, l&#8217;utilizzo di queste tecnologie nella forensica digitale è ancora in fase nascente, con applicazioni limitate a domini specifici piuttosto che sistemi autonomi integrati.</p>\n<h4>Stato dell&#8217;arte: dalla ricerca accademica all&#8217;implementazione operativa</h4>\n<p>La ricerca sull&#8217;intelligenza artificiale applicata alla forensica digitale ha registrato un&#8217;accelerazione significativa negli ultimi anni. Lo <a href=\"https://www.amresearchreview.com/index.php/Journal/article/view/49\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">studio di Khaliq</a> et al. <em>Revolutionizing Cyber Forensics: Advance Digital Evidence Analysis through Machine Learning Techniques</em> (2025) pubblicato su <em>Annual Methodological Archive Research Review</em> ha analizzato tecniche avanzate di machine learning per la classificazione delle prove digitali, raggiungendo<strong> accuratezze del 94,3%</strong> <strong>nella categorizzazione automatica delle evidenze</strong> e del <strong>92,7% nell&#8217;identificazione di anomalie di rete</strong>. Questi risultati impressionanti vanno però contestualizzati: molte sperimentazioni utilizzano dataset controllati che non riflettono pienamente la complessità dei dati forensi reali.</p>\n<p>Il NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) ha pubblicato nel settembre 2024 il <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/publications/strategic-opportunities-advance-forensic-science-united-states-path-forward-through\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report <em>Strategic Opportunities</em></a> <em>to Advance Forensic Science in the United States</em>, identificando lo sviluppo di metodi analitici basati su algoritmi e intelligenza artificiale tra le quattro &#8220;grand challenges&#8221; della forensica moderna. Il documento sottolinea non solo l&#8217;importanza dell&#8217;adozione tecnologica, ma anche la necessità di standard scientifici rigorosi per garantire validità, affidabilità e consistenza dei risultati.</p>\n<p>ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity), nel suo <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2024-2026-condensed-version\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">programma 2024-2026</a>, ha inserito la cybersecurity degli algoritmi di intelligenza artificiale tra le priorità strategiche europee. L&#8217;agenzia riconosce la duplice natura dell&#8217;AI: strumento investigativo potente ma anche possibile vettore di minacce emergenti. Questo crea una corsa tecnologica continua tra investigatori e criminali informatici, dove entrambe le parti utilizzano le stesse tecnologie avanzate.</p>\n<h2>Metodologie AI-driven: analisi tecnica delle architetture algoritmiche</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;implementazione di algoritmi di intelligenza artificiale nelle procedure forensi richiede la comprensione approfondita di diverse architetture di machine learning e delle loro applicazioni specifiche.</p>\n<h4>Natural Language Processing per l&#8217;analisi di log e comunicazioni</h4>\n<p>Le tecniche di Natural Language Processing (NLP) basate su architetture transformer hanno rivoluzionato l&#8217;analisi di grandi volumi di log di sistema, comunicazioni email e messaggistica. <a href=\"https://www.amresearchreview.com/index.php/Journal/article/view/49\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khaliq et al.</a> (2025) hanno dimostrato che i modelli transformer raggiungono <strong>il 95,1% di precisione nell&#8217;identificazione di minacce via email</strong>, superando significativamente gli approcci tradizionali basati su regole.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;applicazione pratica di queste tecniche riguarda l&#8217;analisi automatizzata di conversazioni estratte da dispositivi sequestrati. Gli algoritmi possono identificare pattern linguistici indicativi di attività criminali, keyword correlate a traffici illeciti e reti di comunicazione tra soggetti sospetti. Questo riduce drasticamente i tempi di analisi manuale, che potrebbero altrimenti richiedere settimane o mesi di lavoro.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, l&#8217;applicazione del NLP solleva questioni delicate di privacy. L&#8217;analisi semantica massiva di comunicazioni personali richiede un equilibrio tra efficacia investigativa e tutela dei diritti fondamentali, particolarmente nel contesto delle normative europee.</p>\n<h4>Convolutional Neural Networks per la forensica multimediale</h4>\n<p>Le Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) hanno trasformato l&#8217;analisi di immagini e video nelle indagini forensi. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281723001944\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dunsin et al.</a> (2024) evidenziano l&#8217;efficacia delle reti convoluzionali nell&#8217;identificazione di prove visive, nel rilevamento di alterazioni fotografiche e nell&#8217;analisi di filmati per attività sospette.</p>\n<p>Un&#8217;applicazione paradigmatica riguarda il rilevamento dei deepfake: algoritmi CNN addestrati su dataset multimodali <strong>possono identificare manipolazioni sintetiche con accuracy superiori al 90%.</strong> Si presenta però un paradosso interessante: mentre le CNN diventano più sofisticate nel rilevare contenuti falsificati, le stesse architetture generative (Generative Adversarial Networks) utilizzate per crearli evolvono parallelamente, generando una dinamica competitiva simile a una corsa agli armamenti digitale.</p>\n<h4>Recurrent Neural Networks e analisi delle sequenze temporali</h4>\n<p>Le Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) e le loro varianti più avanzate, come le Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), eccellono nell&#8217;analisi di sequenze temporali. Queste architetture sono fondamentali per ricostruire la timeline di eventi criminali, processando log di sistema cronologici, sequenze di comandi eseguiti e tracce di accesso.</p>\n<p>Una ricerca pubblicata su IIETA (2023) intitolata <a href=\"https://www.iieta.org/journals/ijsse/paper/10.18280/ijsse.130412\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Enhancing Cyber Forensics</em></a> <em>with AI and Machine Learning: A Study on Automated Threat Analysis and Classification</em> realizzata da Bandr Fakiha, ha dimostrato che l&#8217;applicazione di RNN nell&#8217;analisi forense permette di <strong>identificare con precisione del 92% i pattern temporali associati ad attacchi Advanced Persistent Threat</strong> (APT), riducendo significativamente i falsi positivi rispetto alle tecniche tradizionali.</p>\n<h4>Autoencoders per il rilevamento di anomalie</h4>\n<p>Gli autoencoder rappresentano uno strumento potente per il rilevamento di anomalie nei sistemi compromessi. Queste reti neurali, progettate per l&#8217;apprendimento non supervisionato, vengono addestrate su dati &#8220;normali&#8221; e possono quindi identificare deviazioni statistiche indicative di comportamenti malevoli, senza necessità di dataset etichettati di malware noti.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amresearchreview.com/index.php/Journal/article/view/49\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khaliq et al.</a> (2025) hanno implementato autoencoder ottenendo risultati significativi: <strong>identificazione di attività sospette con precisione del 92,7% nel network traffic analizzato in tempo reale</strong>. Questo apre prospettive interessanti per sistemi di threat intelligence automatizzata capaci di adattarsi a minacce emergenti.</p>\n<h2>Analisi critica multidimensionale: evidenze empiriche e casi di studio</h2>\n<h4>A. Evidenze quantitative dall&#8217;implementazione operativa</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;adozione operativa dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nelle indagini forensi ha prodotto risultati misurabili significativi. Lo <a href=\"https://www.iieta.org/journals/ijsse/paper/10.18280/ijsse.130412\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">studio condotto da ricercatori</a> dell&#8217;Università di Umm Al-Qura (Arabia Saudita, 2023) ha raccolto dati empirici da organizzazioni che hanno implementato AI e machine learning nella forensica informatica, rivelando miglioramenti sostanziali:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Riduzione del 57% nei tempi di analisi forense rispetto alle metodologie tradizionali</li>\n<li>Incremento del 40% nella capacità di processamento di grandi volumi di dati in casi complessi</li>\n<li>Miglioramento del 35% nell&#8217;accuratezza di identificazione di artefatti rilevanti</li>\n</ul>\n<p>È importante sottolineare che questi miglioramenti si concentrano in domini applicativi specifici: analisi di malware, data carving e classificazione automatica di file. Le capacità di ragionamento investigativo olistico, correlazione inter-contestuale e interpretazione semantica rimangono ancora prevalentemente dominio dell&#8217;intelligenza umana.</p>\n<h4>B. Caso di studio 1: Framework blockchain-enhanced per l&#8217;analisi di malware</h4>\n<p>Un caso emblematico pubblicato nel gennaio 2025 dai ricercatori del G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering (India) e intitolato <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5106294\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blockchain Enhanced AI Digital Forensic Framework for Malware Analysis</em></a> illustra l&#8217;integrazione innovativa di intelligenza artificiale e tecnologia blockchain per la forensica del malware.</p>\n<p>Il framework combina un modulo di analisi basato su machine learning per l&#8217;identificazione e classificazione automatica del malware attraverso analisi statica (estrazione di caratteristiche da file eseguibili senza esecuzione) e analisi dinamica (monitoraggio comportamentale in ambiente sandbox). La classificazione multi-classe viene effettuata mediante algoritmi ensemble.</p>\n<p>Il componente blockchain garantisce l&#8217;immutabilità della catena di custodia (chain of custody), timestamp crittograficamente verificabili per ogni operazione forense e resistenza alla manomissione delle evidenze digitali.</p>\n<p>Il sistema ha dimostrato capacità di identificare varianti di malware precedentemente sconosciute con accuratezza dell&#8217;89%, significativamente superiore ai sistemi basati esclusivamente su firme. L&#8217;overhead computazionale della blockchain introduce però latenze nell&#8217;ordine dei secondi per ogni transazione di evidenza registrata, potenzialmente problematico in scenari di incident response in tempo reale.</p>\n<h4>C. Caso di studio 2: Sistema di explainable AI per la rilevazione di crimini informatici</h4>\n<p>La ricerca condotta da Billah (2025) presso la Bangladesh University of Professionals intitolato <a href=\"https://www.forensicscijournal.com/journals/jfsr/jfsr-aid1089.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Developing an Explainable AI System for Digital Forensics: Enhancing Trust and Transparency in Flagging Events for Legal Evidence</em></a> rappresenta un avanzamento significativo verso l&#8217;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) nella forensica digitale.</p>\n<p>Il sistema combina algoritmi di deep learning per la rilevazione di eventi criminali informatici con tecniche XAI (SHAP &#8211; SHapley Additive exPlanations e LIME &#8211; Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) per generare spiegazioni interpretabili. L&#8217;interfaccia utente consente agli investigatori di visualizzare il razionale delle classificazioni in modo comprensibile.</p>\n<p>I risultati sono notevoli: <strong>accuracy del 94,3% nella rilevazione di cybercrime, riduzione del 67% del tempo necessario per validare manualmente le classificazioni</strong> e spiegazioni comprensibili anche da investigatori senza competenze di data science.</p>\n<p>Il sistema è stato testato con avvocati e magistrati, ottenendo un tasso di <strong>comprensibilità del 78% delle spiegazioni algoritmiche</strong>. Questo rappresenta un passo significativo verso l&#8217;ammissibilità giuridica delle prove generate da intelligenza artificiale, affrontando la criticità del &#8220;black box problem&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>D. Caso di studio 3: Intelligenza artificiale nella forensica di dispositivi mobili</h4>\n<p>Una survey su 122 professionisti della forensica digitale condotta nel 2024 (DFPulse) intitolata <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2666281724000568\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Artificial intelligence in mobile forensics: A survey of current status, a use case analysis and AI alignment objectives</em></a> ha evidenziato tendenze significative nell&#8217;adozione di AI per l&#8217;analisi di dispositivi mobili.</p>\n<p>Le principali sfide operative identificate includono l&#8217;eterogeneità dei dispositivi (versioni Android personalizzate da Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi rendono complessa la standardizzazione), il volume di applicazioni (milioni di app con formati dati proprietari) e la cifratura end-to-end crescente che limita l&#8217;efficacia dell&#8217;analisi automatizzata.</p>\n<p>Le applicazioni AI implementate con successo riguardano la categorizzazione automatica di immagini mediante algoritmi CNN, l&#8217;analisi semantica cross-modale che correla testo, immagini e metadati, e il topic modeling guidato dalla conoscenza per esaminare efficacemente grandi volumi di dati.</p>\n<p>La ricerca ha rivelato che il 68% degli investigatori considera l&#8217;AI utile per il triage iniziale delle evidenze, ma solo il 23% si fiderebbe completamente di classificazioni automatiche senza supervisione umana. Questo evidenzia la persistenza di gap di fiducia significativi nella comunità forense.</p>\n<h2>Sfide critiche: dimensioni tecnologiche, legali ed etiche</h2>\n<h4>Il problema dell&#8217;explainability e l&#8217;ammissibilità giuridica</h4>\n<p>La questione dell&#8217;explainability rappresenta la sfida più critica per l&#8217;adozione forense dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale. Come evidenziato da Magnet Forensics nel articolo <a href=\"https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/evaluating-the-use-of-ai-in-digital-evidence-and-courtroom-admissibility/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Evaluating the use of AI in digital evidence and courtroom admissibility</em></a> (2025), i sistemi giudiziari federali statunitensi si affidano al Daubert Standard per l&#8217;introduzione di testimonianze scientifiche innovative.</p>\n<p>Gli strumenti forensi basati su AI devono soddisfare cinque criteri fondamentali: testabilità della tecnica, peer review e pubblicazione scientifica, tasso di errore noto e controllato, accettazione nella comunità scientifica rilevante e affidabilità con risultati consistenti e replicabili.</p>\n<p>Il problema è che molti algoritmi di deep learning operano come &#8220;black boxes&#8221;: anche quando producono risultati accurati, il processo decisionale interno rimane opaco. Come notato dall&#8217;Honorable Paul Grimm nel <em>Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property</em>, quando la metodologia viene trattata come segreto commerciale dal sviluppatore, impedendone la verifica, diventa difficile sostenere l&#8217;autenticità e l&#8217;ammissibilità delle prove generate.</p>\n<h4>Explainable AI: verso la trasparenza algoritmica</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) emerge come soluzione fondamentale a questo problema. Ricercatori Shahid Alam e Zeynep Altiparmak nella pubblicazione <em>XAI-CF – </em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02452\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Examining the Role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Forensics</em></a> (2024) hanno formalizzato il concetto di XAI-CF (XAI for Cyber Forensics), definendo requisiti specifici per sistemi utilizzabili nel contesto forense.</p>\n<p>Le caratteristiche essenziali includono l&#8217;interpretabilità (gli investigatori devono comprendere come l&#8217;algoritmo raggiunge conclusioni), la giustificabilità (i risultati devono essere supportati da razionale tracciabile), l&#8217;interattività (possibilità di interrogare il sistema per chiarimenti) e l&#8217;autenticità (le spiegazioni devono riflettere accuratamente i meccanismi decisionali reali).</p>\n<p>Uno studio del Digital Society <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44206-023-00081-z\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Explainable AI and Law: An Evidential Survey</em></a> (2024) ha condotto una survey sistematica sulla XAI nel contesto legale, evidenziando che logiche giuridiche diverse (ragionamento evidenziale, decisionale, procedurale) richiedono forme differenziate di spiegabilità algoritmica. Non esiste un approccio XAI universale: i sistemi devono essere calibrati sui requisiti specifici del contesto legale.</p>\n<h4>Bias algoritmici e discriminazione sistemica</h4>\n<p>I bias algoritmici rappresentano una minaccia significativa all&#8217;equità delle investigazioni forensi. Ricerche documentate come quella di Rohit Tahsildar Yadav <a href=\"https://ijsret.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IJSRET_V10_issue4_353.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AI-Driven Digital Forensics</em></a> hanno identificato diverse fonti di distorsione che meritano attenzione critica.</p>\n<p>La sottorappresentazione culturale nei dataset di addestramento costituisce un problema serio: gli studi forensi storicamente si sono concentrati su contesti occidentali, limitando l&#8217;efficacia dell&#8217;AI con gruppi demografici diversi. Lo sbilanciamento delle classi, con dataset che presentano distribuzione non uniforme di esempi, può generare modelli che identificano male varianti rare di malware o comportamenti anomali.</p>\n<p>Un caso emblematico riguarda sistemi di riconoscimento facciale che hanno dimostrato <strong>tassi di errore superiori del 34% per individui afroamericani rispetto a caucasici</strong>, sollevando preoccupazioni etiche fondamentali sull&#8217;applicazione forense di tali tecnologie.</p>\n<p>Le strategie di mitigazione includono audit algoritmici regolari per valutare le performance su sottogruppi demografici, l&#8217;incorporazione di fairness constraints nei processi di ottimizzazione e la diversificazione dei dataset con inclusione intenzionale di variabilità culturale, geografica e contestuale.</p>\n<h4>Privacy, GDPR e trattamento dei dati forensi</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;utilizzo di intelligenza artificiale nelle indagini forensi genera tensioni tra efficacia investigativa e tutela della privacy. Il GDPR europeo impone principi stringenti che devono essere rispettati anche nelle attività forensi: minimizzazione (raccolta solo dei dati strettamente necessari), limitazione della finalità (utilizzo esclusivo per scopi dichiarati) e diritto alla spiegazione (possibilità di richiedere chiarimenti su decisioni automatizzate).</p>\n<p>Come evidenziato nel <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14638\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documento <em>Improving Cybercrime Detection and Digital Forensics Investigations with Artificial Intelligence</em></a> realizzato da Silvia Lucia Sanna, Leonardo Regano, Davide Maiorca, e Giorgio Giacinto dell&#8217;Università di Cagliari (ottobre 2024), l&#8217;applicazione di machine learning richiede spesso l&#8217;analisi di grandi volumi di dati personali sensibili, potenzialmente in contrasto con i principi di minimizzazione. Le tecniche XAI che forniscono spiegazioni attraverso esempi del training set potrebbero involontariamente esporre dati personali di terzi non coinvolti nell&#8217;indagine, violando il GDPR.</p>\n<p>Le soluzioni operative includono l&#8217;implementazione di differential privacy (tecniche che aggiungono rumore controllato per proteggere l&#8217;identificabilità individuale), il federated learning (addestramento distribuito che mantiene i dati locali) e audit di conformità sistematici per verificare l&#8217;aderenza al GDPR prima del deployment.</p>\n<h4>Attacchi adversarial e robustezza dei modelli</h4>\n<p>La vulnerabilità dei sistemi AI forensi ad attacchi adversarial rappresenta un aspetto critico spesso sottovalutato. Criminali informatici sofisticati possono manipolare intenzionalmente evidenze digitali per ingannare algoritmi di classificazione.</p>\n<p>Le tipologie di attacchi includono gli evasion attacks (modifiche minime a malware per eludere la rilevazione), i poisoning attacks (contaminazione dei dataset di addestramento con esempi malevoli) e il model inversion (tecniche per estrarre informazioni sensibili dai modelli addestrati).</p>\n<p>I ricercatori dell&#8217;Università di Caglari hanno dimostrato che il malware può rilevare ambienti sandbox utilizzati per l&#8217;analisi dinamica e alterare il proprio comportamento, ingannando i sistemi di classificazione automatica. Questo evidenzia la necessità di approcci ibridi che combinino rilevazione automatizzata e validazione umana esperta.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive interdisciplinari e riflessioni critiche</h2>\n<h4>Il paradosso dell&#8217;automazione forense</h4>\n<p>Emerge un paradosso fondamentale nell&#8217;applicazione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale alle indagini forensi: più i sistemi diventano sofisticati e autonomi, più diventa critica la competenza umana per interpretarne e validarne i risultati.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;automazione non sostituisce gli investigatori ma sposta il carico cognitivo verso livelli di astrazione superiore. Gli investigatori forensi devono ora comprendere principi di machine learning e limiti statistici dei modelli, metodologie di validazione algoritmica, implicazioni legali dell&#8217;explainability e gestione dei bias.</p>\n<p>Questa elevazione delle competenze richieste rappresenta simultaneamente una sfida educativa e un&#8217;opportunità professionale: la forensica digitale evolve verso una disciplina profondamente interdisciplinare che integra informatica, statistica, diritto e scienze cognitive.</p>\n<h4>Intelligenza artificiale e modifiche al burden of proof</h4>\n<p>I sistemi automatizzati che producono classificazioni con confidence scores elevati (es. &#8220;questo file è malware con probabilità del 97%&#8221;) potrebbero creare aspettative irrealistiche di certezza scientifica. La natura probabilistica intrinseca dei modelli di machine learning introduce inevitabilmente margini di incertezza.</p>\n<p>Come conciliare l&#8217;esigenza giuridica di prova &#8220;oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio&#8221; con output algoritmici intrinsecamente probabilistici? La questione rimane aperta e richiede dialogo approfondito tra comunità scientifica e giuridica per sviluppare framework interpretativi adeguati.</p>\n<h4>Implicazioni per la standardizzazione internazionale</h4>\n<p>La natura transnazionale del cybercrime rende cruciale la standardizzazione internazionale delle metodologie forensi basate su AI. Esistono però divergenze significative tra giurisdizioni che complicano l&#8217;armonizzazione.</p>\n<p>Gli standard americani (Daubert, Frye) enfatizzano la testabilità scientifica e l&#8217;accettazione nella comunità di riferimento. Gli standard europei (GDPR, NIS2) danno priorità a privacy, protezione dati e diritti fondamentali. Gli standard asiatici mostrano variabilità significativa tra paesi con approcci più permissivi o restrittivi.</p>\n<p>NIST e ENISA stanno lavorando a framework armonizzati, ma il processo è complesso. La mancanza di standard globali rischia di creare frammentazione metodologica che complica la cooperazione investigativa internazionale.</p>\n<h4>Intelligenza artificiale generativa: nuova frontiera e nuova minaccia</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;avvento di large language models (LLM) e AI generativa introduce dimensioni ulteriori alla forensica digitale con implicazioni contraddittorie.</p>\n<p>Da un lato, questi sistemi offrono opportunità forensi come l&#8217;analisi semantica avanzata di comunicazioni sospette, la generazione automatica di report investigativi e l&#8217;assistenza nella ricostruzione di timeline complesse attraverso natural language queries.</p>\n<p>Dall&#8217;altro, rappresentano minacce emergenti: generazione di prove digitali sintetiche (deepfake audio/video, documenti falsificati), creazione automatizzata di malware polimorfo e generazione di alibi digitali artificiali (falsi log, timestamp manipolati).</p>\n<p>Lo studio già citato <em>Digital forensics and strong AI: A structured literature review</em> ha esplorato la forensica di servizi AI conversazionali come ChatGPT, Copilot e Gemini, evidenziando che le interazioni con questi sistemi possono costituire prove rilevanti in investigazioni, ma richiedono metodologie specializzate per l&#8217;acquisizione e la preservazione.</p>\n<h2>Direzioni future: trend emergenti e ricerca necessaria</h2>\n<h4>Post-quantum cryptography e implicazioni forensi</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;avvento del quantum computing introdurrà una discontinuità fondamentale nella forensica digitale. Gli algoritmi crittografici attuali (RSA, ECC) diventeranno vulnerabili, ma contemporaneamente emergeranno schemi post-quantistici che complicheranno ulteriormente l&#8217;analisi forense di comunicazioni cifrate.</p>\n<p>Il quantum computing potrebbe sia potenziare capacità forensi (decifratura retroattiva di comunicazioni archiviate) sia limitarle (nuovi protocolli crittografici più robusti). La comunità forense deve prepararsi investendo in ricerca su algoritmi forensi quantum-resistant, metodologie per analisi di artefatti post-quantistici e framework legali per gestire discontinuità crittografiche.</p>\n<h4>Federated learning per cooperazione investigativa transnazionale</h4>\n<p>Il federated learning rappresenta un paradigma promettente per la condivisione di intelligence tra agenzie forensi internazionali preservando la privacy. I modelli ML possono essere addestrati collaborativamente su dati distribuiti senza trasferimento di dataset sensibili, superando barriere legali e di sovranità.</p>\n<p>Ricerche preliminari del team dell&#8217;Università di Cagliari suggeriscono applicabilità a database condivisi di firme malware tra CERT nazionali, classificatori collaborativi per cybercrime transnazionale e threat intelligence distribuita con privacy differenziale.</p>\n<p>Le sfide tecniche includono la gestione dell&#8217;eterogeneità dei dati (non-IID data), la protezione contro attacchi al protocollo federato e la governance del consenso per gli aggiornamenti dei modelli.</p>\n<h4>Intelligenza artificiale per la forensica predittiva</h4>\n<p>Un&#8217;applicazione controversa ma potenzialmente rivoluzionaria riguarda la forensica predittiva: utilizzo di AI per anticipare crimini informatici imminenti o identificare bersagli probabili.</p>\n<p>Le applicazioni concrete includono l&#8217;identificazione proattiva di vulnerabilità in infrastrutture critiche prima dello sfruttamento, la predizione di target ransomware basata su analisi di pattern di attacchi precedenti e early warning per campagne phishing emergenti.</p>\n<p>Le criticità etiche sono significative: rischio di profilazione discriminatoria, violazioni della presunzione di innocenza e feedback loops che auto-confermano bias. Questo richiede framework etici e legali rigorosi prima del deployment operativo.</p>\n<h4>Explainable AI di nuova generazione</h4>\n<p>La ricerca XAI sta evolvendo verso tecniche più sofisticate che promettono maggiore utilità nel contesto forense.</p>\n<p>Le counterfactual explanations spiegano cosa sarebbe successo cambiando specifiche caratteristiche (&#8220;Il sistema avrebbe classificato diversamente se la caratteristica X fosse stata Y&#8221;). La causal inference identifica relazioni causali non solo correlazioni statistiche. I concept activation vectors forniscono spiegazioni basate su concetti semantici interpretabili piuttosto che features numeriche astratte.</p>\n<p>Nella sua pubblicazione M. Billah dimostra che le spiegazioni counterfactual sono particolarmente efficaci nel contesto forense, consentendo agli investigatori di comprendere quali elementi probatori specifici hanno determinato una classificazione e come modifiche minimali potrebbero alterarla.</p>\n<h2>Agenda di ricerca prioritaria</h2>\n<p>Sulla base dell&#8217;analisi condotta, identifichiamo cinque aree di ricerca critiche per il futuro della forensica digitale basata su intelligenza artificiale:</p>\n<p>Standardizzazione internazionale XAI forense: Sviluppo di framework condivisi per explainability accettabile in diverse giurisdizioni, con particolare attenzione all&#8217;armonizzazione tra sistemi common law e civil law.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robustezza adversarial</strong>: Tecniche difensive avanzate contro manipolazioni intenzionali di prove digitali, inclusi metodi di adversarial training e rilevazione di perturbazioni malevole.</li>\n<li><strong>Gestione dell&#8217;incertezza</strong>: Metodologie per quantificare e comunicare l&#8217;incertezza algoritmica in contesti legali, traducendo confidence scores probabilistici in linguaggio comprensibile a giudici e giurie.</li>\n<li><strong>Mitigazione dei bias</strong>: Strategie sistematiche per identificare, quantificare e ridurre distorsioni algoritmiche, con particolare enfasi sull&#8217;equità procedurale e la giustizia sostanziale.</li>\n<li><strong>Human-AI teaming</strong>: Paradigmi ottimali di collaborazione tra investigatori e sistemi AI che massimizzano le sinergie cognitive, definendo chiaramente ruoli, responsabilità e processi decisionali condivisi.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusioni: verso una forensica digitale augmented</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale e del machine learning nelle indagini forensi digitali rappresenta una trasformazione irreversibile della disciplina. Le evidenze empiriche dimostrano che gli algoritmi investigativi possono amplificare significativamente le capacità umane: riduzioni fino al <strong>57%</strong> dei tempi di analisi, <strong>accuratezze superiori al 94%</strong> in classificazioni complesse e capacità di processare volumi di dati altrimenti inaccessibili.</p>\n<p>Questa rivoluzione tecnologica presenta però tensioni fondamentali che non possono essere ignorate. Il &#8220;black box problem&#8221; solleva questioni irrisolte sull&#8217;ammissibilità giuridica delle prove generate automaticamente. I bias algoritmici rischiano di perpetuare o amplificare ingiustizie sistemiche. Le vulnerabilità ad attacchi adversarial introducono nuove superfici di rischio. La compliance con framework di protezione della privacy come il GDPR richiede bilanciamenti delicati.</p>\n<p>La via da seguire non passa attraverso un&#8217;adozione acritica dell&#8217;AI né attraverso un rifiuto conservatore. Richiede un approccio critico, metodologicamente rigoroso e eticamente consapevole che privilegi l&#8217;explainability come requisito fondamentale, implementi governance robusta con audit sistematici, investa massicciamente in formazione interdisciplinare degli investigatori, promuova standardizzazione internazionale e mantenga supervisione umana su decisioni investigative critiche.</p>\n<p>La forensica digitale del futuro sarà una disciplina augmented: intelligenza artificiale e umana in sinergia complementare, dove algoritmi gestiscono la complessità computazionale mentre gli investigatori apportano giudizio contestuale, intuizione investigativa e responsabilità etica. Questo paradigma richiede evoluzione culturale, normativa e tecnologica, ma rappresenta l&#8217;unica via sostenibile per affrontare la crescente sofisticazione del cybercrime preservando equità procedurale e diritti fondamentali.</p>\n<h4>Note:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666281723001944\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dunsin, D., Ghanem, M.

      "content": "<p>La Digital Forensics rappresenta oggi il fondamento metodologico per comprendere l&#8217;evoluzione dell&#8217;intelligence digitale contemporanea. Questo articolo fa parte di una serie di approfondimenti dedicati all&#8217;Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) e all&#8217;Advertising Intelligence (ADINT), due approcci investigativi che stanno ridefinendo il panorama della sicurezza digitale e della raccolta informativa.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;analisi esplora come la Digital Forensics fornisca il substrato scientifico necessario per implementare efficacemente sia le tecniche OSINT, basate su fonti pubblicamente accessibili, sia le metodologie ADINT, che sfruttano l&#8217;ecosistema pubblicitario digitale per scopi investigativi. Particolare attenzione viene dedicata al contesto normativo europeo, con focus su GDPR e AI Act, e all&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale nei processi forensi.</p>\n<h2>Digital Forensics e l’ecosistema della sorveglianza digitale</h2>\n<p>La Digital Forensics, nel panorama investigativo odierno, fornisce gli strumenti e le metodologie necessarie per l’identificazione, la raccolta, l&#8217;acquisizione, la conservazione delle prove in forma digitale<a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/feed/#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>, l&#8217;analisi e la presentazione delle prove digitali in modo scientificamente valido e legalmente ammissibile.</p>\n<h4>L&#8217;evoluzione della Digital Forensics</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;evoluzione della Digital Forensics riflette la trasformazione del panorama tecnologico e, come mostrato dallo studio condotto da Vasilaras et al. (2024), l&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;IA ha portato ad un salto qualitativo nelle capacità investigative. Questa ricerca, basata su un&#8217;indagine condotta presso 48 istituti forensi e agenzie di <em>“law enforcement”</em>, rivela che il 77% delle organizzazioni utilizza già capacità di AI nei loro software forensi, in particolar modo per la classificazione di immagini e video.</p>\n<p>Questa evoluzione si manifesta in tre dimensioni principali:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Capacità tecniche: l&#8217;introduzione di algoritmi di Machine Learning ha potenziato notevolmente la capacità di analizzare grandi volumi di dati digitali. Come evidenzia Suryal (2024), i moderni strumenti forensi possono processare e categorizzare automaticamente enormi quantità di metadati, facilitando in questo modo l&#8217;identificazione di pattern e connessioni rilevanti per le indagini;</li>\n<li>Metodologie operative: le procedure forensi si sono evolute per incorporare le nuove capacità tecnologiche mantenendo al contempo la necessaria rigidità scientifica. Questo ha portato allo sviluppo di protocolli standardizzati per l&#8217;acquisizione e l&#8217;analisi delle prove digitali;</li>\n<li>Framework legali: il quadro normativo, in particolar modo nell’Unione Europea, si è adattato per affrontare le sfide poste dalle nuove tecnologie. Il GDPR e l&#8217;AI Act forniscono linee guida specifiche per il trattamento dei dati personali e l&#8217;utilizzo dell&#8217;AI nel contesto forense.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Framework OSINT e ADINT: metodologie operative per l&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali</h4>\n<p>La Digital Forensics fornisce il substrato metodologico per entrambe le tecniche investigative principali discusse in questa tesi. Per l&#8217;OSINT, fornisce gli strumenti necessari per l&#8217;acquisizione e l&#8217;analisi scientifica delle fonti aperte, mentre per l&#8217;ADINT supporta l&#8217;analisi dei dati pubblicitari e delle tracce digitali lasciate dagli utenti.</p>\n<p>Vasilaras et al. (2024) identificano tre aspetti fondamentali in questa integrazione:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trasparenza: i sistemi forensi devono essere trasparenti nel loro funzionamento, permettendo di comprendere come vengono generate le prove digitali. Questo è particolarmente importante negli Stati membri dell’UE, dove l&#8217;AI Act richiede che i sistemi automatizzati siano spiegabili;</li>\n<li>Interpretabilità: i risultati delle analisi forensi devono essere interpretabili non solo dagli esperti tecnici ma anche dagli operatori del diritto. Questo requisito assume particolare rilevanza quando si utilizzano tecniche avanzate di IA;</li>\n<li>Robustezza: le metodologie forensi devono essere sufficientemente robuste da resistere al controllo giuridico e scientifico. La loro affidabilità deve essere dimostrabile in modo oggettivo.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>La standardizzazione delle procedure</h4>\n<p>Un aspetto critico emerso dalla ricerca di Vasilaras et al. (ibidem) è l&#8217;assenza di procedure standardizzate per l&#8217;utilizzo dell&#8217;IA nelle investigazioni forensi digitali. Questo rappresenta una sfida particolare nel contesto europeo, dove il quadro normativo richiede un alto livello di trasparenza e <em>accountability</em>.</p>\n<p>Per rispondere a questa sfida, gli autori suggeriscono un <em>framework</em> di governance strutturato, che integra diversi elementi chiave per garantire la conformità normativa e l’affidabilità delle analisi forensi. Uno degli aspetti centrali del <em>framework</em> è l&#8217;adozione di protocolli standardizzati per l&#8217;acquisizione delle prove digitali, assicurando che la raccolta e la conservazione delle informazioni seguano criteri uniformi, tali da preservarne l&#8217;integrità e l&#8217;ammissibilità in contesti giudiziari.</p>\n<p>Inoltre, viene enfatizzata l&#8217;importanza di procedure di validazione rigorose per gli algoritmi di intelligenza artificiale utilizzati nelle indagini, al fine di garantire trasparenza, spiegabilità e assenza di bias nei processi decisionali automatizzati. Un ulteriore pilastro del <em>framework</em> è rappresentato dai meccanismi di audit, progettati per monitorare e verificare costantemente la conformità ai requisiti normativi, riducendo il rischio di violazioni e garantendo una maggiore accountability nelle pratiche di digital forensics. Infine, il <em>framework</em> prevede l’implementazione di linee guida dettagliate per la documentazione delle analisi forensi, assicurando la tracciabilità e la riproducibilità delle indagini, elementi essenziali per la validazione delle prove e la credibilità del lavoro investigativo.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"background-color: #d5d5d5;\">Le </span>sfide future</h4>\n<p>La Digital Forensics si trova ad affrontare una serie di sfide complesse e in continua evoluzione, che risultano particolarmente rilevanti nel contesto dell’OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) e dell’ADINT (Advertising Intelligence). L’analisi forense digitale, che si occupa della raccolta, conservazione e interpretazione di prove digitali, deve adattarsi a un panorama tecnologico in rapido cambiamento, garantendo al contempo il rispetto delle normative sulla privacy e l’affidabilità delle informazioni raccolte.</p>\n<p>Tra le principali sfide che emergono, la prima riguarda l’evoluzione tecnologica e il rapido sviluppo delle tecnologie digitali, che impongono un aggiornamento costante delle metodologie e degli strumenti utilizzati nella Digital Forensics. L’adozione di reti decentralizzate, il crescente utilizzo di sistemi di crittografia avanzati e la diffusione di dispositivi IoT rendono sempre più complesso l’accesso e l’analisi delle informazioni. Inoltre, le nuove piattaforme basate su blockchain e tecniche di anonimizzazione pongono ostacoli significativi alla tracciabilità delle attività online, richiedendo lo sviluppo di strumenti più elaborati.</p>\n<p>Un altro aspetto cruciale è il bilanciamento tra efficacia investigativa e protezione della privacy. L’attuale quadro normativo, con regolamenti stringenti come il GDPR, impone restrizioni sulla raccolta e sull’uso dei dati personali, limitando l’accesso a determinate fonti di informazione. Un esempio di questo conflitto riguarda l&#8217;analisi OSINT dove, pur basandosi su dati pubblicamente accessibili, il loro utilizzo può comunque sollevare questioni etiche e legali, specialmente quando si tratta di profilazione avanzata o di attacchi che permettono l’estrapolazione di informazioni sensibili da dati apparentemente innocui.</p>\n<p>Un ulteriore sfida riguarda la standardizzazione delle procedure e delle metodologie forensi, visto che la grande varietà di tecnologie, formati di dati e piattaforme digitali rende difficile la creazione di un protocollo unico e universalmente accettato per la raccolta e l’analisi delle prove digitali. I software e le tecniche di analisi utilizzati nelle indagini variano notevolmente a seconda della giurisdizione e dell’ambito operativo, generando problemi di interoperabilità tra diversi sistemi. La mancanza di standard uniformi può influenzare l’affidabilità delle indagini e la capacità di condividere informazioni tra diverse agenzie investigative.</p>\n<p>Infine, l’ammissibilità legale delle prove digitali rappresenta un ostacolo sempre più complesso. Difatti, per essere utilizzabili in tribunale le prove digitali devono soddisfare rigorosi requisiti di autenticità, integrità e tracciabilità. Ogni fase della raccolta e dell’analisi deve essere documentata per garantire la catena di custodia, evitando contestazioni sulla validità delle prove. Inoltre, l’uso crescente di intelligenza artificiale e machine learning nelle indagini forensi introduce nuove sfide legate alla trasparenza degli algoritmi e alla spiegabilità dei risultati. La giurisprudenza sta ancora cercando di adattarsi a queste innovazioni, con differenze significative tra le normative adottate nei vari paesi.</p>\n<p>Oltre a queste quattro sfide principali, emergono ulteriori problematiche legate alla sovrabbondanza di dati disponibili per l’analisi forense e al rischio di manipolazione delle informazioni digitali. L’aumento delle tecniche di <em>deepfake</em> e di alterazione forense dei dati rende più difficile distinguere tra contenuti autentici e manipolati, aumentando la necessità di strumenti di verifica avanzati.</p>\n<p>Per affrontare queste sfide, è fondamentale investire in formazione specialistica, sviluppo di strumenti forensi avanzati e creazione di normative più flessibili ma efficaci, che consentano agli investigatori digitali di operare in modo efficiente senza compromettere i diritti fondamentali dei cittadini. Il futuro della Digital Forensics dipenderà dalla capacità di adattarsi a un ecosistema digitale in continua trasformazione, mantenendo un equilibrio tra innovazione tecnologica e tutela della giustizia.</p>\n<h2>OSINT: generalità ed evoluzione</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) rappresenta uno dei pilastri fondamentali dell&#8217;intelligence digitale contemporanea. Da strumento tradizionalmente utilizzato in ambito militare e governativo, l&#8217;OSINT si è evoluto fino a diventare un metodo sofisticato per la raccolta e analisi di informazioni da fonti pubblicamente accessibili, con particolare rilevanza nel contesto dei social media e delle piattaforme digitali.</p>\n<p><em>Fonte: Bederov, I. (2024) “How to track a person using open data?”</em></p>\n<h4>Evoluzione storica e definizione</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;OSINT ha origini che precedono l&#8217;era digitale, essendo stata inizialmente sviluppata come metodologia per l&#8217;analisi di fonti informative pubbliche durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Con l&#8217;avvento di Internet e dei social media, ha subito un cambiamento profondo, ampliando le sue metodologie e potenzialità. Suryal (2024) evidenzia come la crescente disponibilità di dati digitali abbia introdotto una rivoluzione nell&#8217;OSINT, migliorando l&#8217;accesso a fonti di dati e tecniche di analisi.</p>\n<p>Hayes e Cappa (2018) sottolineano l&#8217;importanza dell&#8217;OSINT per migliorare la sicurezza aziendale e nazionale, dimostrando come questa metodologia permetta di identificare vulnerabilità tecniche e umane nelle infrastrutture critiche e nel personale chiave. Inoltre, Yadav et al. (2023) illustrano il ruolo crescente dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale e del machine learning nell&#8217;OSINT, che permette un&#8217;analisi più approfondita dei dati e l&#8217;implementazione di modelli autonomi per la gestione delle minacce.</p>\n<p>Nel contesto contemporaneo, l&#8217;OSINT si distingue per la sua dipendenza da fonti pubblicamente accessibili, una caratteristica che comporta significative implicazioni legali ed etiche, particolarmente nel contesto europeo regolato dal GDPR.</p>\n<h4>Metodologie e strumenti</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;OSINT moderna utilizza una varietà di strumenti per la raccolta e l&#8217;analisi dei dati. Suryal (2024) identifica sei categorie principali di metadati utili per le investigazioni OSINT:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>EXIF data</em>: informazioni tecniche e contestuali sulle immagini;</li>\n<li><em>Geotags</em>: per tracciare dimensioni geografiche delle informazioni;</li>\n<li><em>Timestamps</em>: per ricostruire eventi temporali;</li>\n<li><em>User metadata</em>: dettagli sui comportamenti degli utenti;</li>\n<li><em>File properties</em>: dati tecnici sui file digitali;</li>\n<li><em>Social graph data</em>: relazioni tra utenti e contenuti.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hayes e Cappa (2023) integrano questa visione analizzando il modo in cui strumenti come “Maltego” e “FOCA” possano mappare connessioni e individuare metadati nascosti, migliorando l&#8217;efficacia delle analisi. Parallelamente, Yadav et al. (2018) descrivono l&#8217;uso di algoritmi di deep learning per rilevare schemi nei dati, migliorando la capacità predittiva delle applicazioni OSINT, soprattutto nel campo della sicurezza informatica.</p>\n<h4>Il ruolo dei social media</h4>\n<p>I social media hanno trasformato l&#8217;OSINT in una risorsa chiave per investigazioni e analisi di rischio. Le piattaforme social forniscono un ricco tessuto informativo che, se analizzato correttamente, può rivelare dettagli significativi su individui, organizzazioni ed eventi. Come evidenziato da Suryal (2024), l&#8217;analisi delle fonti aperte deve bilanciare efficacia investigativa e rispetto della privacy. Nella ricerca svolta da Hayes e Cappa (2018), si dimostra che le reti sociali rappresentano sia un&#8217;opportunità per il monitoraggio di minacce sia un rischio, visto che offrono dati che possono essere sfruttati per l&#8217;ingegneria sociale.</p>\n<h4>Sfide tecniche e metodologiche</h4>\n<p>Le sfide principali dell&#8217;OSINT comprendono la gestione dei dati, la verifica delle informazioni e l&#8217;integrazione di fonti eterogenee. Per affrontarle sono emersi strumenti avanzati spesso supportati da tecnologie di IA, in grado di migliorare sia la velocità sia la precisione delle analisi. Nella ricerca svolta da Hayes e Cappa (2018) si illustra, ad esempio, come la classificazione del rischio dei dipendenti possa orientare le risorse aziendali verso una maggiore sicurezza.</p>\n<h3>Prospettive future</h3>\n<p>Il futuro dell&#8217;OSINT sarà sempre più influenzato dall&#8217;evoluzione tecnologica e dalla regolamentazione normativa. L&#8217;integrazione con l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale e il machine learning offre un potenziale significativo per la personalizzazione delle analisi e l&#8217;automazione dei processi, come dimostrato da Yadav et al. (2023). Tuttavia, è importante affrontare le varie questioni etiche e normative, soprattutto nel contesto europeo, dove la protezione dei dati rappresenta una priorità fondamentale.</p>\n<h2>ADINT: generalità ed evoluzione</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;Advertising Intelligence (ADINT) rappresenta una delle innovazioni più significative e potenzialmente dirompenti nel panorama dell&#8217;intelligence digitale contemporanea. Come dimostrato da Vines, Roesner e Kohno (2017) nella loro ricerca, l&#8217;infrastruttura pubblicitaria digitale può essere utilizzata per mettere in atto forme sofisticate di sorveglianza con risorse relativamente limitate.</p>\n<h4>Il funzionamento dell&#8217;ADINT</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;ADINT sfrutta in modo innovativo l&#8217;ecosistema pubblicitario esistente. Gli autori della ricerca hanno dimostrato come, con un budget di soli mille dollari, sia possibile:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tracciare la posizione degli individui con una precisione di 8 metri attraverso il targeting pubblicitario cosiddetto “iperlocale”. Questo termine viene usato per riferirsi ad una forma molto precisa di pubblicità basata sulla localizzazione, che permette agli inserzionisti di targetizzare gli utenti in aree geografiche molto ristrette. In particolar modo, il <em>targeting</em> iperlocale consente di indirizzare le pubblicità agli utenti basandosi sulle loro coordinate GPS esatte con un livello di granularità molto fine (fino a circa 4-11 metri di risoluzione) e di definire aree target circolari con raggi minimi di 1 metro intorno a coordinate GPS specifiche. In questo modo è in grado di mostrare annunci solo agli utenti all&#8217;interno di quelle precise aree geografiche;</li>\n<li>Inferire informazioni sensibili sull&#8217;utilizzo di determinate applicazioni, incluse app per dating, religiose o mediche (dunque i cosiddetti “dati ad alto rischio”, cioè quei dati che, se pubblicati e scoperti da un attore malevolo, porterebbero potenzialmente a danni importanti a quella determinata persona, come ad esempio frodi e il furto d’identità);</li>\n<li>Monitorare gli spostamenti quotidiani tra casa e lavoro;</li>\n<li>Determinare il numero di dispositivi presenti in una determinata località;</li>\n<li>Identificare le connessioni sociali tra utenti basandosi sui pattern di co-localizzazione (ciò può essere usato per monitorare raduni o eventi).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questo funzionamento si basa su un meccanismo relativamente semplice ma molto efficace: l&#8217;acquisto mirato di spazi pubblicitari per i dispositivi mobili permette di verificare se un particolare utente visualizza l&#8217;annuncio in una specifica posizione o mentre utilizza determinate applicazioni.</p>\n<h4>L&#8217;ecosistema pubblicitario dei dispositivi mobili (Mobile Advertising) nel contesto europeo</h4>\n<p>La ricerca mostra come diverse piattaforme pubblicitarie per i dispositivi mobili forniscano agli inserzionisti informazioni molto dettagliate. Un caso particolare è “MoPub”, che condivide sia l&#8217;identificatore del dispositivo (GAID o hash dell&#8217;Android ID) che la localizzazione precisa, permettendo potenzialmente la ricostruzione dei percorsi degli utenti.</p>\n<p>Nell’Unione Europea questa pratica solleva rilevanti questioni di conformità al GDPR, toccando diversi principi fondamentali della protezione dei dati personali. Uno degli aspetti più critici riguarda il requisito del consenso informato, indispensabile per il trattamento dei dati di localizzazione, che deve essere esplicito, libero e revocabile in qualsiasi momento.</p>\n<p>Parallelamente, il trattamento di tali informazioni deve basarsi su una base giuridica legittima, che giustifichi la raccolta e l’analisi dei dati personali, garantendo il rispetto delle normative vigenti. Un ulteriore elemento essenziale è rappresentato dall’obbligo di trasparenza, che impone ai soggetti responsabili del trattamento di chiarire in modo dettagliato le finalità per cui i dati vengono raccolti e utilizzati, evitando ambiguità o usi impropri.</p>\n<p>Infine, si applica il principio di minimizzazione dei dati, che richiede di limitare la raccolta esclusivamente alle informazioni strettamente necessarie per gli scopi dichiarati, evitando un accumulo eccessivo o non giustificato di dati sensibili. Questi aspetti rendono il trattamento dei dati di localizzazione una questione complessa, che richiede un equilibrio tra necessità operative e rispetto della privacy individuale.</p>\n<h4>Implicazioni privacy e vulnerabilità</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;Advertising Intelligence solleva preoccupazioni significative per quanto riguarda la privacy degli utenti. Come dimostrato da Goldfarb e Que (2023) nella loro ricerca, il valore crescente dei dati digitali ha creato forti incentivi economici per lo sviluppo di tecniche sempre più sofisticate di tracciamento e profilazione.</p>\n<h4>Contromisure e mitigazioni</h4>\n<p>La ricerca propone diverse strategie per mitigare i rischi associati all’Advertising Intelligence (ADINT) e garantire una maggiore tutela degli utenti. Una delle soluzioni proposte consiste nell’introduzione di limitazioni tecniche, che impongano restrizioni sulla precisione dei dati di localizzazione condivisi con gli inserzionisti, riducendo così il rischio di tracciamento invasivo e di profilazione dettagliata. Un altro approccio riguarda l’inasprimento dei controlli normativi, con una regolamentazione più rigorosa sull’utilizzo dei dati pubblicitari per scopi di sorveglianza, impedendo che informazioni destinate a fini commerciali vengano sfruttate per attività di monitoraggio non autorizzate.</p>\n<p>A questo si affianca la necessità di una maggiore trasparenza, che garantisca agli utenti una chiara comprensione di come i loro dati vengano raccolti, trattati e utilizzati nel sistema pubblicitario, dando loro la possibilità di esercitare un controllo più efficace sulle proprie informazioni personali. Per concludere, un ulteriore aspetto cruciale è l’implementazione del principio di <em>privacy by design</em>, che prevede lo sviluppo di sistemi pubblicitari in cui la protezione della privacy sia integrata fin dalle fasi iniziali della progettazione. Questo implica l’adozione di meccanismi che minimizzino la raccolta dei dati, limitino la conservazione delle informazioni personali e offrano agli utenti strumenti per gestire in modo semplice e consapevole il proprio livello di esposizione ai meccanismi di tracciamento pubblicitario.</p>\n<h4>Prospettive future</h4>\n<p>Il futuro dell&#8217;Advertising Intelligence sarà probabilmente caratterizzato da uno scontro continuo tra le crescenti capacità tecniche e le esigenze di protezione della privacy. Inoltre, l&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;IA potrebbe rendere ancora più elaborate le capacità di inferenza e tracciamento.</p>\n<p>Nel contesto europeo, con l&#8217;<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/it/policies/regulatory-framework-ai\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI Act</a> ci saranno ulteriori requisiti per i sistemi automatizzati utilizzati nella pubblicità, potenzialmente limitando alcune delle capacità dell&#8217;ADINT. Tuttavia, come evidenziano Vines et al. (2017), la natura essenzialmente aperta dell&#8217;ecosistema pubblicitario rende piuttosto difficile prevenire del tutto queste tipologie di sorveglianza.</p>\n<h2>Differenze e similitudini tra i due approcci</h2>\n<p><strong> </strong>L&#8217;analisi comparativa tra OSINT e ADINT rivela un quadro complesso di convergenze e divergenze metodologiche che merita un&#8217;attenta considerazione. Questa comparazione risulta particolarmente significativa nel contesto europeo, dove il quadro normativo impone vincoli specifici ad entrambe le metodologie.</p>\n<h4>Fondamenti metodologici</h4>\n<p>La principale differenza tra OSINT e ADINT riguarda le rispettive metodologie. L&#8217;OSINT si basa sull&#8217;analisi sistematica di fonti pubblicamente accessibili, seguendo una tradizione consolidata di intelligence. Come evidenzia Suryal (2024), questa metodologia si è evoluta per incorporare le nuove fonti di dati digitali, mantenendo però il suo focus sulla raccolta e analisi di informazioni pubblicamente disponibili.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;ADINT, al contrario, rappresenta un approccio innovativo che, come dimostrato da Vines et al. (2017), sfrutta in modo creativo l&#8217;infrastruttura pubblicitaria digitale per i dispostivi mobili esistente per ottenere informazioni che normalmente non sarebbero accessibili attraverso fonti aperte. Questa differenza fondamentale ha importanti implicazioni sia tecniche che etiche.</p>\n<h4>Acquisizione delle informazioni</h4>\n<p>Le modalità di acquisizione delle informazioni differiscono significativamente tra i due approcci. L’OSINT si basa su fonti pubblicamente accessibili, usa strumenti appositamente creati per l’aggregazione dei dati, e le competenze richieste variano da ciò che si desidera fare. Ad esempio, per fare una ricerca su dove è maggiormente diffuso un determinato argomento su X (ex Twitter) basteranno competenze minime, mentre per combinare i dati delle immagini satellitari presenti su Google Maps e quelle presenti su X per analizzare un determinato conflitto si avrà bisogno di competenze avanzate.</p>\n<p>Per quanto riguarda l’ADINT, essa sfrutta in maniera attiva l’infrastruttura pubblicitaria digitale, e richiede un certo investimento economico (anche se, come dimostrato in precedenza, sono sufficienti risorse economiche limitate). L’Advertising Intelligence opera attraverso l’acquisto di spazi pubblicitari per i dispositivi mobili, e dunque sfrutta gli strumenti standard del c.d. <em>“digital advertising”</em>.</p>\n<h4>Implicazioni legali nel contesto europeo</h4>\n<p>Nel contesto normativo europeo, sia l’Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) che l’Advertising Intelligence (ADINT) devono operare nel rispetto del Regolamento Generale sulla Protezione dei Dati (GDPR) e dell’AI Act, affrontando tuttavia sfide specifiche legate alla natura stessa dei dati trattati e alle modalità di raccolta e analisi delle informazioni.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;OSINT, essendo basato sulla raccolta e l’analisi di dati provenienti da fonti pubbliche, si trova a dover gestire questioni legali complesse legate alla legittimità dell’aggregazione delle informazioni disponibili online. Nonostante molte delle fonti siano pubbliche per definizione, la loro raccolta e aggregazione su larga scala potrebbe entrare in conflitto con i principi di minimizzazione dei dati e finalità del trattamento previsti dal GDPR. Un’altra problematica riguarda i limiti del riutilizzo delle informazioni, poiché i dati originariamente resi pubblici per uno scopo specifico non possono sempre essere riutilizzati liberamente per finalità investigative o di profilazione.</p>\n<p>Un ulteriore requisito fondamentale per l’OSINT è la documentazione della provenienza dei dati, che garantisce non solamente la trasparenza del processo di raccolta, ma è fondamentale per dimostrare la validità e l’affidabilità delle informazioni, soprattutto in contesti giudiziari o investigativi.</p>\n<p>L’ADINT, invece, essendo direttamente coinvolto nella raccolta di dati a fini commerciali e pubblicitari, deve affrontare restrizioni ancora più stringenti. Il consenso informato degli utenti è un requisito essenziale, e secondo il GDPR deve essere esplicito, libero e revocabile in qualsiasi momento. La sfida principale per le aziende che utilizzano ADINT è quindi quella di garantire trasparenza nelle finalità del trattamento, evitando pratiche opache o ambigue nella gestione dei dati.</p>\n<p>Questo implica la necessità di informare chiaramente gli utenti su come i loro dati verranno utilizzati, evitando formulazioni vaghe o generiche. Inoltre, il principio della minimizzazione dei dati raccolti impone alle aziende di raccogliere solo le informazioni strettamente necessarie per lo scopo dichiarato, evitando di accumulare grandi volumi di dati senza una giustificazione adeguata. Infine, la limitazione delle finalità richiede che i dati acquisiti per una determinata attività non possano essere riutilizzati per scopi diversi senza un nuovo consenso, rendendo più complesso l’uso secondario delle informazioni all’interno delle strategie di marketing e pubblicità.</p>\n<p>In sintesi, sia per l’OSINT che per l’ADINT l’ambiente normativo è sempre più complesso, dato che la necessità di accesso ai dati si scontra con le rigorose tutele imposte per la protezione della privacy. Per entrambe le metodologie l&#8217;adozione di strategie conformi ai principi di <em>accountability</em>, trasparenza e protezione dei dati diventerà cruciale per operare in modo efficace senza incorrere in violazioni regolamentari.</p>\n<h2>Capacità investigative e integrazione futura di OSINT e ADINT</h2>\n<p>Le capacità investigative di OSINT e ADINT rappresentano approcci complementari ma distinti per quanto riguarda la raccolta di informazioni. L&#8217;OSINT dimostra particolare efficacia nell&#8217;analisi delle reti sociali, nella ricostruzione di eventi pubblici, nella verifica delle informazioni dichiarate e nell&#8217;identificazione di pattern e tendenze sociali più ampie. Per contro, l&#8217;ADINT eccelle nel tracciamento preciso delle localizzazioni, nell&#8217;inferenza di comportamenti privati, nell&#8217;analisi dei pattern di movimento e nella valutazione dei comportamenti di gruppo.</p>\n<p>Per quanto riguarda l&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;IA, Vasilaras et al. (2024) evidenziano come ciascun approccio affronti sfide specifiche. L&#8217;Open Source Intelligence richiede algoritmi sofisticati capaci di processare e analizzare grandi volumi di dati mantenendo accuratezza contestuale e trasparenza analitica. L&#8217;Advertising Intelligence, d&#8217;altra parte, si concentra sullo sviluppo di algoritmi predittivi per il targeting, affrontando al contempo le sfide della c.d. <em>“privacy preserving computation”</em> (cioè un sistema in cui l’output non contiene dati identificabili oltre a ciò che è stato dato dall’utente nell’input) e della spiegabilità delle decisioni.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;evoluzione futura di entrambi gli approcci è condizionata da fattori distinti ma interconnessi, visto che la traiettoria di sviluppo dell&#8217;OSINT è influenzata dalla crescente disponibilità di dati pubblici e dall&#8217;evoluzione delle piattaforme social, mentre il futuro dell&#8217;ADINT è legato ai cambiamenti nell&#8217;ecosistema pubblicitario e ai progressi nelle tecnologie di <em>targeting</em>. Entrambi devono adattarsi a un panorama normativo in evoluzione, particolarmente all&#8217;interno del robusto quadro sulla privacy dell&#8217;Unione Europea.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista etico, entrambi gli approcci condividono preoccupazioni comuni riguardo al bilanciamento tra efficacia investigativa e protezione della privacy, nonché al potenziale impatto sui diritti fondamentali. Tuttavia, differiscono significativamente nel loro contesto operativo: l&#8217;OSINT lavora con informazioni pubblicate volontariamente, mentre l&#8217;ADINT opera spesso attraverso meccanismi che gli utenti potrebbero non comprendere pienamente e con autorizzazioni che l’utente potrebbe concedere senza volerlo.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;integrazione potenziale tra OSINT e ADINT, come suggerito dallo studio svolto da Goldfarb e Que (2023), offre prospettive promettenti per capacità investigative avanzate, ma richiede particolare attenzione agli aspetti etici e legali, specialmente nel contesto europeo. La sfida principale consiste nello sviluppare <em>framework</em> di integrazione che rispettino i principi del GDPR, mantengano la trasparenza delle procedure e garantiscano sia l&#8217;interpretabilità dei risultati che la tutela dei diritti fondamentali degli individui.</p>\n<p>Questa visione di integrazione deve necessariamente considerare le specificità del contesto europeo, dove la protezione dei diritti fondamentali assume un ruolo pivotale nella regolamentazione delle tecnologie investigative, distinguendosi significativamente dall&#8217;approccio normativo statunitense più orientato al mercato.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;analisi presentata ha evidenziato come Digital Forensics, OSINT e ADINT rappresentino tre pilastri interconnessi dell&#8217;intelligence digitale contemporanea, ciascuno con specificità metodologiche e sfide normative distintive nel contesto europeo. L&#8217;integrazione dell&#8217;intelligenza artificiale ha amplificato le capacità investigative di tutti e tre gli approcci, richiedendo tuttavia framework di governance più sofisticati per garantire conformità al GDPR e all&#8217;AI Act.</p>\n<p>Nel prossimo articolo approfondiremo gli spetti tecnici della raccolta e analisi dati per l&#8217;approccio OSINT e ADINT, esplorando strumenti, metodologie operative e implementazioni pratiche per professionisti del settore.</p>\n<p>Per un ulteriore approfondimento invitiamo a scaricare il white paper di <strong>Sergiu Deaconu</strong>, &#8220;<strong><a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/pubblicazioni/open-source-intelligence-e-advertising-intelligence-applicazioni-e-impatti-in-ambito-industriale-civile-e-dellintelligence-europea/\">Open Source Intelligence e Advertising Intelligence: applicazioni e impatti in ambito industriale, civile e dell&#8217;intelligence europea&#8221;</a>.</strong> Il documento offre un&#8217;analisi approfondita su come OSINT e ADINT stiano trasformando il settore dell&#8217;intelligence digitale.</p>\n<h5>Fonti:</h5>\n<p>[1] Come definito dalla norma ISO 27037 del 2017 (febbraio) corretta il 10 maggio 2022 a pagina 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/feed/#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a></p>",
