In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.<br /><br />While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/15/1124949/bodies-heat-climate-change-extreme-temperatures/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Max G.Levy</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This story is from the latest print issue of MIT Technology Review magazine, which is full of fascinating stories about the body.

Don’t blame wind turbines.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whale deaths have become a political flashpoint. There are currently three active mortality events for whales in the Atlantic, meaning clusters of deaths that experts consider unusual. And Republican lawmakers, conservative think tanks, and—most notably—President Donald Trump (a longtime enemy of wind power) are making dubious claims that offshore wind farms are responsible.<br /><br />But any finger-pointing at wind turbines for whale deaths ignores the fact that whales have been washing up on beaches since long before the giant machines were rooted in the ocean floor. This is something that has always happened. And the scientific consensus is clear: There’s no evidence that wind farms are the cause of recent increases in whale deaths. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126728/whales-are-dying-dont-blame-wind-turbines/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Casey Crownhart</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This story is part of <em>MIT Technology Review</em>’s series “The New Conspiracy Age,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.

That should be particularly worrying in the US, where massive data centers are waiting to come online. It doesn’t look as if the country will build the steady power supply or infrastructure needed to serve them all.<br /><br />It wasn’t always like this. For about a decade before 2020, data centers were able to offset increased demand with efficiency improvements. Now, though, electricity demand is ticking up in the US, with billions of queries to popular AI models each day—and efficiency gains aren’t keeping pace.<br /><br />If we want AI to have the chance to deliver on big promises without driving electricity prices sky-high for the rest of us, the US needs to learn some lessons from the rest of the world on energy abundance. Just look at China.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/09/1126805/the-state-of-ai-energy-is-king-and-the-us-is-falling-behind/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Casey Crownhart &amp; Pilita Clark</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is from The State of AI, our subscriber-only collaboration between the<em> Financial Times</em> &amp; <em>MIT Technology Review</em> examining the ways in which AI is reshaping global power.<br /><br />Every Monday for the next four weeks, writers from both publications will debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution reshaping global power.

In 2006, Hoare was a 29-year-old computer programmer working for Mozilla. After a software crash broke the elevator in his building, he set about designing a new computer language; one that he hoped would make it possible to write small, fast code without memory bugs.<br /><br />That language developed into Rust, one of the hottest new languages on the planet. But while it isn’t unusual for someone to make a new computer language, it’s incredibly rare for one to take hold and become part of the programming pantheon.

That should be particularly worrying here in the US, where massive data centers are waiting to come online, and it doesn’t look as if the country will build the steady power supply or infrastructure needed to serve them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t always like this. For about a decade before 2020, data centers were able to offset increased demand <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">with efficiency improvements</a>. Now, though, electricity demand is ticking up in the US, with billions of queries to popular AI models each day—and efficiency gains aren’t keeping pace. With too little new power capacity coming online, the strain is starting to show: Electricity bills are ballooning for people who live in places where data centers place a growing load on the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want AI to have the chance to deliver on big promises without driving electricity prices sky-high for the rest of us, the US needs to learn some lessons from the rest of the world on energy abundance. Just look at China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China installed 429 GW of new power generation capacity in 2024, more than six times the net capacity added in the US during that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China still generates much of its electricity with coal, but that makes up a declining share of the mix. Rather, the country is focused on installing solar, wind, nuclear, and gas at record rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US, meanwhile, is focused on reviving its ailing coal industry. Coal-fired power plants are polluting and, crucially, expensive to run. Aging plants in the US are also less reliable than they used to be, generating electricity just 42% of the time, compared with a 61% capacity factor in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a great situation. And unless the US changes something, we risk becoming consumers as opposed to innovators in both energy and AI tech. Already, China earns more from exporting renewables than the US does from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-05/china-s-clean-energy-exports-are-beating-us-fossil-fuels\">oil and gas exports.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building and permitting new renewable power plants would certainly help, since they’re currently the cheapest and fastest to bring online. But wind and solar are politically unpopular with the current administration. Natural gas is an obvious candidate, though there are concerns about delays with key equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One quick fix would be for data centers to be more flexible. If they agreed not to suck electricity from the grid during times of stress, new AI infrastructure might be able to come online without any new energy infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One study from Duke University found that if data centers agree to curtail their consumption just 0.25% of the time (roughly 22 hours over the course of the year), the grid could provide power for about 76 GW of new demand. That’s like adding about 5% of the entire grid’s capacity without needing to build anything new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But flexibility wouldn’t be enough to truly meet the swell in AI electricity demand. What do you think, Pilita? What would get the US out of these energy constraints? Is there anything else we should be thinking about when it comes to AI and its energy use?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pilita Clark responds:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree. Data centers that can <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/how-were-making-data-centers-more-flexible-to-benefit-power-grids/\">cut</a> their power use at times of grid stress should be the norm, not the exception. Likewise, we need more deals like those <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/2016/11/14/microsoft-announces-largest-wind-energy-purchase-to-date/\">giving</a> cheaper electricity to data centers that let power utilities access their backup generators. Both reduce the need to build more power plants, which makes sense regardless of how much electricity AI ends up using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a critical point for countries across the world, because we still don’t know exactly how much power AI is going to consume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forecasts for what data centers will need in as little as five years’ time <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-data-centres/\">vary wildly</a>, from less than twice today’s rates to four times as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is partly because there’s a lack of public <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z\">data</a> about AI systems’ energy needs. It’s also because we don’t know how much more efficient these systems will become. The US chip designer Nvidia said last year that its specialized chips had become <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ai-energy-efficiency/\">45,000 times</a> more <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-innovation-curb-ais-hunger-for-power-e9c3d8bc\">energy</a> efficient over the previous eight years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, we have been very wrong about tech energy needs before. At the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, it was erroneously <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html\">claimed</a> that the internet would need half the US’s electricity within a decade—necessitating a lot more coal power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, some countries are clearly feeling the pressure already. In Ireland, data centers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f6111a8-0249-4a28-aef4-1854fc8b46f1\">chew up</a> so much power that new connections have been <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1013/1538245-data-centre-policy/\">restricted</a> around Dublin to avoid straining the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some regulators are eyeing new rules forcing tech companies to provide enough power generation to match their demand. I hope such efforts grow. I also hope AI itself helps boost power abundance and, crucially, accelerates the global energy transition needed to combat climate change. OpenAI’s Sam Altman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC-0XqTAeMQ\">said</a> in 2023 that “once we have a really powerful super intelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence so far is not promising, especially in the US, where renewable projects are being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a3cd922-88ed-4188-86ab-ba09fbe24d42\">axed</a>. Still, the US may end up being an outlier in a world where ever cheaper renewables made up <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Mar/Record-Breaking-Annual-Growth-in-Renewable-Power-Capacity#:~:text=With%20585%20GW%20of%20capacity,of%20new%20capacity%20in%202024.\">more than 90%</a> of new power capacity added globally last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Europe is aiming to power one of its <a href=\"https://www.startcampus.pt/\">biggest data centers</a> predominantly with renewables and batteries. But the country leading the green energy expansion is clearly China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 20th century was dominated by countries rich in the fossil fuels whose reign the US now wants to prolong. China, in contrast, may become the world’s first green electrostate. If it does this in a way that helps it win an AI race the US has so far controlled, it will mark a striking chapter in economic, technological, and geopolitical history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Casey Crownhart replies:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I share your skepticism of tech executives’ claims that AI will be a groundbreaking help in the race to address climate change. To be fair, AI is progressing rapidly. But we don’t have time to wait for technologies standing on big claims with nothing to back them up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the grid, for example, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/09/1123404/ai-grid-help/\">experts say</a> there’s potential for AI to help with planning and even operating, but these efforts are still experimental.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, much of the world is making measurable progress on transitioning to newer, greener forms of energy. How that will affect the AI boom remains to be seen. What is clear is that AI is changing our grid and our world, and we need to be clear-eyed about the consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>MIT Technology Review</em> reporters did the math on <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/\">the energy needs of an AI query</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few reasons to be <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/\">optimistic about AI’s energy demands</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>FT</em>’s visual data team take a look<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-data-centres/\">inside the relentless race for AI capacity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And global <em>FT</em> reporters ask whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f6111a8-0249-4a28-aef4-1854fc8b46f1\">data centers can ever truly be green</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>AI and quantum technologies are dramatically reconfiguring how cybersecurity functions, redefining the speed and scale with which digital defenders and their adversaries can operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1127802\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CISCO-iStock-2156608663.jpg\" width=\"1773\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weaponization of AI tools for cyberattacks is already proving a worthy opponent to current defenses. From reconnaissance to ransomware, cybercriminals can automate attacks faster than ever before with AI. This includes using generative AI to create social engineering attacks at scale, churning out tens of thousands of tailored phishing emails in seconds, or accessing widely available voice cloning software capable of bypassing security defenses for as little as a few dollars. And now, agentic AI raises the stakes by introducing autonomous systems that can reason, act, and adapt like human adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But AI isn’t the only force shaping the threat landscape. Quantum computing has the potential to seriously undermine current encryption standards if developed unchecked. Quantum algorithms can solve the mathematical problems underlying most modern cryptography, particularly public-key systems like RSA and Elliptic Curve, widely used for secure online communication, digital signatures, and cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We know quantum is coming. Once it does, it will force a change in how we secure data across everything, including governments, telecoms, and financial systems,” says Peter Bailey, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s security business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most organizations are understandably focused on the immediacy of AI threats,&#8221; says Bailey. “Quantum might sound like science fiction, but those scenarios are coming faster than many realize. It’s critical to start investing now in defenses that can withstand both AI and quantum attacks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical to this defense is a zero trust approach to cybersecurity, which assumes no user or device can be inherently trusted. By enforcing continuous verification, zero trust enables constant monitoring and ensures that any attempts to exploit vulnerabilities are quickly detected and addressed in real time. This approach is technology-agnostic and creates a resilient framework even in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Putting up AI defenses&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is lowering the barrier to entry for cyberattacks, enabling hackers even with limited skills or resources to infiltrate, manipulate, and exploit the slightest digital vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.darktrace.com/blog/survey-findings-ai-cyber-threats-are-a-reality-the-people-are-acting-now\">Nearly three-quarters (74%) of cybersecurity professionals</a> say AI-enabled threats are already having a significant impact on their organization, and 90% anticipate such threats in the next one to two years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“AI-powered adversaries have advanced techniques and operate at machine speed,” says Bailey. “The only way to keep pace is to use AI to automate response and defend at machine speed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, Bailey says, organizations must modernize systems, platforms, and security operations to automate threat detection and response—processes that have previously relied on human rule-writing and reaction times. These systems must adapt dynamically as environments evolve and criminal tactics change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, companies must strengthen the security of their AI models and data to reduce exposure to manipulation from AI-enabled malware. Such risks could include, for instance, prompt injections, where a malicious user crafts a prompt to manipulate an AI model into performing unintended actions, bypassing its original instructions and safeguards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agentic AI further ups the ante, with hackers able to use AI agents to automate attacks and make tactical decisions without constant human oversight. “Agentic AI has the potential to collapse the cost of the kill chain,” says Bailey. “That means everyday cybercriminals could start executing campaigns that today only well-funded espionage operations can afford.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations, in turn, are exploring how AI agents can help them stay ahead. Nearly 40% of companies expect agentic AI to augment or assist teams over the next 12 months, especially in cybersecurity, according to <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/solutions/ai/readiness-index/2025-m10/documents/cisco-ai-readiness-index-2025-realizing-the-value-of-ai.pdf\">Cisco’s 2025 AI Readiness Index</a>. Use cases include AI agents trained on telemetry, which can identify anomalies or signals from machine data too disparate and unstructured to be deciphered by humans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Calculating the quantum threat</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As many cybersecurity teams focus on the very real AI-driven threat, quantum is waiting on the sidelines. Almost three-quarters (73%) of US organizations <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/quantum-and-cybersecurity.html\">surveyed by KPMG</a> say they believe it is only a matter of time before cybercriminals are using quantum to decrypt and disrupt today’s cybersecurity protocols. And yet, the majority (81%) also admit they could do more to ensure that their data remains secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies are right to be concerned. Threat actors are already carrying out <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/q-day-apocalypse-quantum-computers-encryption/\">harvest now, decrypt later attacks</a>, stockpiling sensitive encrypted data to crack once quantum technology matures. Examples include state-sponsored actors intercepting government communications and cybercriminal networks storing encrypted internet traffic or financial records.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large technology companies are among the first to roll out quantum defenses. For example, <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/\">Apple is using cryptography protocol PQ3</a> to defend against harvest now, decrypt later attacks on its iMessage platform. <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/announcing-quantum-safe-digital-signatures-in-cloud-kms\">Google is testing post-quantum cryptography (PQC)</a>—which is resistant to attacks from both quantum and classical computers—in its Chrome browser. And Cisco “has made significant investments in quantum-proofing our software and infrastructure,” says Bailey. “You’ll see more enterprises and governments taking similar steps over the next 18 to 24 months,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulations like the US <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/25/what-the-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-preparedness-act-means-for-national-security/\">Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act</a> lay out requirements for mitigating against quantum threats, including standardized PQC algorithms by the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, a wider range of organizations will start preparing their own quantum defenses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For organizations beginning that journey, Bailey outlines two key actions. First, establish visibility. “Understand what data you have and where it lives,” he says. “Take inventory, assess sensitivity, and review your encryption keys, rotating out any that are weak or outdated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, plan for migration. “Next, assess what it will take to support post-quantum algorithms across your infrastructure. That means addressing not just the technology, but also the process and people implications,” Bailey says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Adopting proactive defense&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the foundation for building resilience against both AI and quantum is a zero trust approach, says Bailey. By embedding zero trust access controls across users, devices, business applications, networks, and clouds, this approach grants only the minimum access required to complete a task and enables continuous monitoring. It can also minimize the attack surface by confining a potential threat to an isolated zone, preventing it from accessing other critical systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into this zero trust architecture, organizations can integrate specific measures to defend against AI and quantum risks. For instance, quantum-immune cryptography and AI-powered analytics and security tools can be used to identify complex attack patterns and automate real-time responses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Zero trust slows down attacks and builds resilience,” Bailey says. “It ensures that even if a breach occurs, the crown jewels stay protected and operations can recover quickly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, companies should not wait for threats to emerge and evolve. They must get ahead now. “This isn’t a what-if scenario; it’s a when,” says Bailey. “Organizations that invest early will be the ones setting the pace, not scrambling to catch up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

Critics have argued that its short-term focus on novel and naive ideas results in unrealistic and ungrounded recommendations.<br /><br />Today, some groups are working to reform both design thinking’s principles and its methodologies. These new efforts seek a set of design tools capable of equitably serving diverse communities and solving diverse problems well into the future. It’s a much more daunting—and crucial—task than design thinking’s original remit. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/09/1067821/design-thinking-retrospective-what-went-wrong/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Rebecca Ackermann</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>We can still have nice things</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day.

They can take the form of giant circles and squares, cloverleafs and octagons, complex S-curves and simple mounds.<br /><br />Until recently, it seemed as if much of the continent’s pre-European archaeological heritage had been carelessly wiped out, uprooted, and lost for good. But traces remain: electromagnetic remnants in the soil that can be detected using specialty surveying equipment. And archaeologists and tribal historians are working together to uncover them. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/20/1068043/finding-indigenous-landscapes-electromagnetic-technology-ohio/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>—Geoff Manaugh</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>We can still have nice things</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day.

      "content": "<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\">Edgar Morin non ha soltanto riflettuto sulla Storia. L’ha anche vissuta. Non sorprende, in questo senso, che un secolo di vita conduca a porsi una domanda così radicale: è possibile trarre lezioni dalla storia? In un’epoca in cui il mondo è entrato in una nuova fase di turbamenti, fatta di guerre, sconvolgimenti climatici e incertezze politiche, il sociologo e filosofo francese, teorico del <em>pensiero complesso</em> e autore di <em>Il Metodo</em> – la sua opera maggiore, in sei volumi – si interroga, in questo breve saggio, sulla possibilità stessa di apprendere dal passato. <a href=\"https://www.garzanti.it/libri/edgar-morin-le-lezioni-della-storia-9788811017998/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Le lezioni della storia</em></a> (traduzione di Alessandro Mola, Garzanti, 2025) concentra infatti un’intera vita di osservazioni, esperienze e dubbi in sedici “lezioni” che, in realtà, non sono lezioni nel senso convenzionale, ma piuttosto risvegli, contro-certezze e ammonimenti contro ogni presunzione di poter dominare il senso del tempo.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><em>Le lezioni della storia</em> colpiscono innanzitutto per la loro apparente semplicità. Alcuni titoli di queste “lezioni” potrebbero sembrare quasi naïf, persino semplicistici a prima vista (“<em>Il risultato di un’azione può essere contrario alla sua prima intenzione</em>”; “<em>L’improbabile può avvenire</em>”). Ma questa impressione iniziale è volutamente ingannevole: la profondità e la densità analitica si dispiegano pienamente nello sviluppo di ciascuna meditazione, rivelando un pensiero rigoroso che trasforma queste massime apparentemente ovvie in veri strumenti di interpretazione storica. In questo senso, la scelta del traduttore di rendere il titolo, originariamente una domanda (<em>Y a-t-il des leçons de l’Histoire ?</em>), in un’affermazione (<em>Le lezioni della storia</em>) conferisce grande senso all’opera.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><strong>Pensare la storia<br />\n</strong>La storia, scrive Morin, non obbedisce né a leggi né a direzioni prefissate. Avanza nella contraddizione, sotto il segno dell’imprevedibile. Da questa constatazione trae del resto la prima lezione del libro, appresa dal suo maestro Georges Lefebvre, illustre storico della Rivoluzione francese e professore alla Sorbona: <em>Il risultato di un’azione può essere contrario alla sua prima intenzione</em>. Questo postulato, che Morin ha poi approfondito e sviluppato sotto il termine di “<em>ecologia dell’azione</em>”, porta il sociologo a concepire la Storia come un sistema di interazioni in cui ogni decisione, diffondendosi in un contesto incerto, finisce per sfuggire ai suoi autori. Lontana da ogni lettura teleologica, la Storia viene qui presentata come un tessuto di ambivalenze: la Rivoluzione ha generato anche il Terrore; un popolo perseguitato può diventare persecutore; le trasformazioni sociali possono produrre esiti contrari alle intenzioni originarie. In un certo senso, Edgar Morin si oppone qui alla tradizione positivista ma anche, in parte, al marxismo ortodosso di cui fu un tempo vicino: la Storia non si dispiega secondo leggi orientate al progresso; si contraddice, si ribalta, si reinventa spesso nell’improbabile.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><strong>L’intelligenza del tragico<br />\n</strong>Ed è proprio in questo riconoscimento dell’imprevedibile che risiede la linfa vitale del pensiero e della saggezza moriniana. Perché sì, l’improbabile può accadere: Atene sconfigge la Persia, l’Urss crolla senza guerra, alcune vittime di ieri diventano i carnefici di oggi. Questi ribaltamenti, lungi dal nutrire istanze relativiste, fondano un’etica della lucidità. Pensare storicamente, per Morin, non significa trarre lezioni, ma imparare a vivere con l’incertezza: accettare la fragilità del senso senza rinunciare alla comprensione.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\">La particolarità di questa prospettiva risiede soprattutto nella duplice esigenza di complessità e auto-osservazione. Storico, pensatore, cittadino devono interrogarsi sulla propria posizione: “<em>Nessuna osservazione è valida senza auto-osservazione</em>”. Questo principio, oggi più che mai, contrasta con molti discorsi e pratiche tecnocratiche e mediatiche che pretendono di parlare “da nessun luogo”, da una posizione priva di bias e di ideologia. Morin ci ricorda qui che ogni conoscenza è situata e che pensare significa sempre <em>pensarsi come pensante</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><strong>Il disincanto del progresso?<br />\n</strong>Uno dei passaggi più significativi e incisivi del saggio riguarda la fede moderna – quasi religiosa – nel progresso. Morin mostra come lo sviluppo scientifico e tecnico non abbia prodotto alcun progresso morale: Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Gaza ne sono la tragica prova. La razionalità che ordina i mezzi non garantisce alcuna finalità etica. Al contrario, può persino trasformarsi in strumento di barbarie. In questo senso, lo si potrebbe avvicinare, sotto certi aspetti, alla <em>Dialettica dell’illuminismo</em> di Adorno e Horkheimer, con la differenza che Morin ne trae una conseguenza più umanista. Per lui, l’unico progresso desiderabile è quello della comprensione: comprensione degli altri, della complessità del mondo, della comunità di destino che lega gli esseri umani e il pianeta. In un’epoca saturata da promesse tecnologiche, intelligenze artificiali e algoritmi predittivi, questa idea acquista una risonanza particolare: l’imprevedibile, che la tecnica vorrebbe eliminare, resta la condizione stessa della libertà.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><strong>Morin, oggi: per un umanesimo senza illusioni né ingenuità<br />\n</strong>L’interesse de <em>Le lezioni della storia</em> non risiede soltanto nella memoria e nella saggezza di un secolo di vita, osservazioni e impegno, ma soprattutto nel modo in cui Morin affronta il nostro presente. Il suo pensiero illumina ciò che egli ha teorizzato come “<a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/viviamo-il-tempo-della-policrisi-globale-e-non-abbiamo-strumenti-per-affrontarla\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>policrisi</em></a>”, cioè l’intreccio di crisi ecologiche, politiche e sociali in cui ogni soluzione genera nuovi disordini. In un’epoca in cui tutto tende a polarizzarsi e semplificarsi, il suo “pensiero complesso” non è più soltanto un metodo, ma anche un’etica intellettuale. Un’etica della modestia e della lucidità: riconoscere che ogni fenomeno è relativo a un contesto, che nessuna conoscenza è totale o assoluta, e che nessuna previsione è certa. Ovviamente, si potrebbe forse rimproverare a Edgar Morin una certa fiducia eccessiva nella “comprensione”, concetto fragile e talvolta ingenuo di fronte alla brutalità del mondo. Ma è proprio questa postura e questa fiducia a costituire la forza della posizione del filosofo e sociologo: Morin non cerca né di salvare né di consolare; invita semplicemente a restare lucidi, cioè a mantenere viva la coscienza del tragico senza rinunciare al pensiero.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\"><strong>Un pensiero di fronte al disordine del mondo<br />\n</strong>In fondo, il libro di Edgar Morin non è tanto un trattato di Storia quanto una meditazione sulla condizione umana. Vi fa dialogare epoche diverse, concetti differenti, eventi disparati per mostrare che le civiltà, come gli individui, vivono nella tensione tra ragione e irragionevolezza, umanità e disumanizzazione. In un’epoca in cui le società occidentali riscoprono il tragico (odio, chiusura identitaria, ritorno della guerra, sconvolgimenti climatici…), il pensiero di Morin funge da richiamo: comprendere non basta, ma senza comprensione tutto si ripete. Pensare la Storia significa dunque rifiutare tanto la disperazione quanto l’ingenuità. Significa accettare il caos senza smettere di cercare senso. Questa è, in fondo, la lezione paradossale di Edgar Morin: la Storia non offre lezioni, ma esige vigilanza dello sguardo, tenerezza del giudizio, intelligenza del tragico.</p>\n<h6 align=\"left\" lang=\"it-IT\">CREDITI FOTO: Edgar Morin no Fronteiras do Pensamento São Paulo 2011.

      "content": "<p>Dal 27 al 30 novembre, a Reggio Emilia, tornano le<strong> Giornate della laicità</strong>, il festival di approfondimento culturale dedicato al pensiero laico, critico e razionale, promosso da <strong>Iniziativa laica, MicroMega e Arci Reggio Emilia</strong>. Tema di questa sedicesima edizione, con la direzione scientifica della filosofa e direttrice di <em>MicroMega </em><strong>Cinzia Sciuto</strong>, è “<strong>Totem e tabù. La libertà al tempo dei nuovi autoritarismi</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Saranno quattro giorni di dibattiti e riflessioni a più voci, che si svolgeranno prevalentemente al Laboratorio Aperto dei Chiostri di San Pietro (via Emilia San Pietro 44c), con la partecipazione di <strong>Gustavo Zagrebelsky, Paola di Nicola Travaglini, Paolo Flores d’Arcais, Giorgia Serughetti, Steven Forti, Giovanni Fornero, Stefano Caserini, Annalisa Corrado, Marco Marzano, Marco Politi, Lucetta Scaraffia, Ilaria Valenzi.</strong></p>\n<p>Quattro giorni per parlare di cittadinanza attiva, democrazia, ambiente, fine vita, Chiesa, violenza contro le donne, disuguaglianze e tanto altro.</p>\n<p>“<strong>Viviamo in un tempo di profondo regresso democratico</strong>. L’onda lunga dello slancio democratico nato nel secondo dopoguerra sembra essersi infranta: al suo posto si staglia un paesaggio sempre più popolato da nuovi totem – verità indiscutibili, simboli sacralizzati, identità intoccabili – e nuovi tabù, che delimitano il perimetro di ciò che si può dire, fare, scegliere” spiega la direttrice del Festival Cinzia Sciuto. “Lo scopo di questa edizione delle Giornate della laicità è proprio questo: <strong>interrogare i nuovi sacri e intoccabili totem, smascherarli, sottoporli al vaglio della ragione e del pensiero critico</strong>, nel solco dell’approccio laico che da sempre anima questo festival. I totem del nostro tempo non si presentano più solo sotto forma religiosa: oggi si sacralizza la sicurezza, che viene opposta sistematicamente alla libertà; si sacralizza la patria; si sacralizzano l’identità nazionale, i confini, l’ordine pubblico, la famiglia ‘naturale’, la vita anche quando diventa tortura. Parallelamente, nuovi tabù si impongono nel discorso pubblico e nell’agenda politica: il fine vita, ancora sostanzialmente escluso da ogni dibattito parlamentare; i diritti riproduttivi, sotto attacco in Italia e nel mondo; il dissenso, costantemente represso e criminalizzato; il diritto internazionale, ridotto sempre più a orpello retorico. In questo scenario <strong>la laicità – intesa non solo come separazione tra Stato e religione, ma come metodo di indagine, postura critica, rifiuto di ogni verità rivelata e di ogni principio di autorità – si conferma uno strumento essenziale</strong> per orientarsi in un mondo che sacralizza e censura, spesso in nome di un ‘bene superiore’ che non ammette obiezione”.</p>\n<p>Tutti gli incontri in presenza sono a ingresso libero.

      "content": "<p>La peggiore crisi umanitaria del XXI secolo. Basta questa affermazione, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162096\">fornita a più riprese </a>da diversi esponenti delle Nazioni Unite, per provare a immaginare la situazione insostenibile in cui si trova il Sudan. Nel paese del Corno d’Africa dal 15 aprile 2023 imperversa una sanguinosissima guerra civile tra le Forze armate sudanesi (Fas), sotto il comando del generale Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, e le Rapid support forces (Rsf), <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/sudan-una-tragedia-che-appare-senza-fine/\">milizia erede dei Janjaweed</a>, gruppo paramilitare arabo  creato dal vecchio dittatore Omar al-Bashir e oggi sotto il controllo del generale Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, detto Hemedti.</p>\n<p><!--mitigo-paywall--></p>\n<p>I numeri descrivono una situazione apocalittica, con più di 150 mila morti, quasi 12 milioni di sfollati <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/sudan\">e almeno 21.2 milioni di persone</a> che stanno affrontando alti livelli di insicurezza alimentare. Oltre un bambino su tre soffre di malnutrizione acuta, una percentuale superiore del 20% rispetto alla soglia che definisce la carestia. Già a luglio del 2024 il Famine review committee (Frc) aveva decretato che in diverse parti del Sudan una carestia era in corso; lo scorso mese questa affermazione è stata confermata aggiungendo nuove zone del paese dove la popolazione non ha più nulla da mangiare. Negli ultimi venti anni la carestia è stata dichiarata solo sei volte, ma il 2025 detiene il record peggiore, con due teatri di guerra che sono rientrati in questa classificazione: il Sudan e Gaza.</p>\n<p>Ma se per Gaza l’opinione pubblica internazionale si sta, giustamente, muovendo, per il popolo sudanese sembra che non valga la stessa solidarietà. Di rado infatti il paese del Corno d’Africa compare sui nostri mezzi di informazione, se non per situazioni eclatanti come le stragi di el Geneina, avvenute poco dopo l’inizio del conflitto, e per il massacro del campo profughi Zamzam, colpito lo scorso aprile. La situazione sul campo non accenna a migliorare; anzi, da ottobre l’offensiva delle Rsf, in risposta alla ripresa della capitale Khartoum da parte delle Fas a marzo, ha portato alla conquista della città di el-Fasher, ultima roccaforte delle Fas nelle regioni del Darfur. La conquista del capoluogo del Nord Darfur è arrivata dopo 500 giorni di assedio della città, che ha condannato le 250 mila persone lì intrappolate a rimanere senza cibo, acqua e medicinali. Una volta caduta, la città è stata teatro di massacri arbitrari, rapimenti e stupri. Secondo quanto hanno riportato le Forze Congiunte, alleate dell’esercito sudanese, le Rsf avrebbero ucciso più di duemila civili in due giorni. I massacri, ripresi dagli stessi miliziani che li hanno condivisi sui loro profili social, sono stati condotti su base etnica, <a href=\"https://x.com/SDN154/status/1982676928277393735\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">come riporta la Rete dei dottori sudanesi</a>, proseguendo la mai interrotta pulizia etnica dei sudanesi non arabi del Darfur. La presa della città ha definitivamente consegnato il controllo di almeno un terzo dell’intero territorio nazionale &#8211; praticamente tutta la parte occidentale e sud-occidentale &#8211; ai paramilitari delle Rsf. Ma l’avanzata della milizia non si ferma, con gli effettivi che muovono verso la capitale della regione del Nord Kordofan El-Obeid, raggiunta il 5 novembre da un attacco che ha causato la morte di almeno 40 persone.</p>\n<p>Mentre i morti continuano e alle offensive da una parte rispondono le controffensive dall’altra, i colloqui di pace non sembra possano portare a un cessate il fuoco. Colloqui che da agosto sono sotto l&#8217;egida del “pacificatore” Trump, che insieme ad Arabia Saudita, Egitto ed Emirati Arabi Uniti (Eau), ha proposto un piano in diversi punti con l’obiettivo di arrivare alla fine delle ostilità. L’11 settembre i quattro paesi &#8211; denominati Quad &#8211; hanno rilasciato una dichiarazione in cui presentavano un&#8217;iniziativa globale per affrontare la crisi sudanese. Una mossa arrivata a seguito della nascita di un governo in esilio che controlla le regioni conquistate delle Rsf e che Hemedti ha chiamato Governo di pace e unità. Le reazioni al piano degli Stati Uniti non si sono fatte attendere. Già il 12 settembre il ministero degli Affari Esteri del governo di al-Burhan ha sottolineato che “qualsiasi discussione sul futuro del paese deve avvenire con la partecipazione esclusiva dei sudanesi, senza interferenze o imposizioni da parte di soggetti esterni”. La risposta delle Rsf invece si è fatta sentire sul campo con la citata presa di el-Fasher e l’avanzata nel Kordofan. Il piano è stato riproposto a seguito del massacro del capoluogo del Nord Darfur ed è stato accolto dalle Nazioni Unite e dall&#8217;Unione africana come una possibilità concreta di silenziare le armi. Giovedì le Rsf <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-rsf-agrees-us-proposal-humanitarian-ceasefire-2025-11-06/\">hanno fatto sapere che</a> “attendono con impazienza di attuare l&#8217;accordo e di avviare immediatamente le discussioni sulle modalità per la cessazione delle ostilità e sui principi fondamentali che guidano il processo politico in Sudan”. Da parte di al-Burhan invece è arrivata una risposta negativa. Dopo aver ringraziato per gli sforzi statunitensi, il Consiglio di difesa sudanese ha aggiunto di aver “deciso di mobilitare il popolo sudanese a sostegno delle forze armate per eliminare le milizie ribelli, nell&#8217;ambito della mobilitazione generale e degli sforzi dello Stato per porre fine a questa ribellione”.</p>\n<p>Quindi nulla cambia, ed era difficile immaginare il contrario. Infatti le potenze regionali del Quad hanno diversi interessi in Sudan. Se da una parte Arabia Saudita ed Egitto sono sempre stati sostenitori di al-Burhan, sia militarmente sia diplomaticamente, dall’altra gli Eau invece hanno sostenuto le Rsf fin dai primi giorni del conflitto. Gli Emirati competono con le altre potenze regionali per imporre una propria egemonia sul Corno d’Africa e i paesi della costa orientale del Continente. Primi importatori di oro del Sudan, gli Eau non potevano che appoggiare le Rsf, che controllano la maggior parte dei siti di estrazione del prezioso metallo nel paese. Ma le mire di Abu Dhabi non si fermano qui, perché l’obiettivo è anche costruire un appoggio sul Mar Rosso, punto di collegamento tra Mediterraneo e Oceano indiano. L’appoggio degli Emirati si è concretizzato nel rifornimento di armamenti alle Rsf, con centinaia di voli arrivati in Somalia e attraverso rotte di terra passanti per la Libia di Haftar e il Ciad, che nel 2023-2024 ha ricevuto due miliardi di dollari dagli Eau nel quadro di un accordo di cooperazione militare. Anche se Abu Dhabi ha sempre negato di fornire armi alle Rsf, decine di indagini delle Nazioni Unite e di organismi indipendenti hanno dimostrato il contrario. Addirittura lo scorso maggio il Sudan <a href=\"https://www.difesaonline.it/2025/11/01/sudan-la-guerra-delloro-chi-ci-guadagna-dal-caos/\">ha citato</a> gli Eau davanti alla Corte internazionale di giustizia, con l’accusa di violazioni connesse alla Convenzione sul genocidio, chiedendo misure provvisorie per la possibile complicità degli Eau nelle violenze contro il popolo Masalita in Darfur. La Corte però ha respinto la richiesta e ha deciso di rimuovere il caso dall’elenco generale, per problemi di giurisdizione. A oggi, dopo l’ennesimo massacro, sia le Rsf sia gli Emirati hanno condannato le atroci violenze avvenute a el-Fasher, con la formazione di Hemedti che ha anche arrestato alcuni dei miliziani che si sono filmati mentre uccidevano decine di civili a sangue freddo. Un’indignazione che però sembrerebbe solo utile a far passare le Rsf e Hemedti non come sanguinari tagliagole ma come una forza di governo con cui fare affari. Un modo per provare a evitare la classificazione delle Rsf come organizzazione terroristica, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/6/sudanese-prime-minister-calls-for-rsf-to-be-labelled-terrorist-group\">chiesta a gran voce</a> dal primo ministro del Consiglio sovrano di transizione del Sudan, Kamil Idris.</p>\n<p>In tutto questo i civili rimangono tra l&#8217;incudine e il martello, massacrati sia dalle Rsf sia dalle milizie legate alle Fas, isolati dagli aiuti umanitari che non arrivano nella stragrande maggioranza del paese e con la speranza che sempre di più fa spazio alla rassegnazione.</p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: ADRE, June 27, 2025 Sudanese refugees enter Chad via Adre crossing in Adre, Chad, on June 24, 2025.

      "content": "<p>Ci vollero cinque tentativi per impiccare Ken Saro-Wiwa: il nodo continuava a sciogliersi. Al primo fallimento gridò dalla forca: “Perché mi trattate così? Che razza di paese è questo?”. Chi aveva ordinato l’esecuzione, il 10 novembre 1995, credeva che quel cappio avrebbe chiuso una questione. Invece l’ha aperta. Da quel giorno di Saro-Wiwa si è parlato ovunque: nei tribunali, nelle università, nelle manifestazioni.</p>\n<p>Saro-Wiwa, nato nel 1941 a Bori, nel Delta del Niger, era innanzitutto uno scrittore, uno di quelli che credeva – ingenuamente, diranno i cinici – nel potere delle parole di cambiare il mondo. Le sue opere non cercavano gloria intellettuale, erano un modo per schierarsi. <em><a href=\"https://www.baldinicastoldi.it/libri/sozaboy/\">Sozaboy</a></em>, con quel pidgin english rotto e meraviglioso, era un’insurrezione linguistica, prendeva la lingua del colonizzatore e la faceva a pezzi. <em>Basi&amp;Co,</em> la sitcom più popolare nella Nigeria degli anni Ottanta, da lui ideata, con milioni di nigeriani che ridevano delle disavventure di un piccolo truffatore di Lagos, era satira tagliente.</p>\n<p>C’era però una battaglia che le parole da sole non potevano vincere. Quella del suo popolo, gli ogoni, la cui vita scorreva in una terra che moriva. Nel Delta del Niger compagnie petrolifere multinazionali, Shell in testa, estraevano greggio – ma senza le tutele ambientali che rispettavano in Occidente – e insieme al petrolio usciva tutto il resto: acque nere dei gas bruciati a cielo aperto, perdite dai condotti, falde contaminate. Un doppio standard che condannava gli ogoni a pagare il prezzo del petrolio che illuminava le città europee. Lo Stato nigeriano incassava le royalties. Le compagnie straniere ottenevano profitti immensi. E agli ogoni – che allora contavano mezzo milione di persone – restava una quota ufficiale del’1,5% e un paesaggio distrutto. I raccolti si riducevano, i pesci morivano, l’aria diventava irrespirabile.</p>\n<p>Saro-Wiwa lo chiamò “genocidio ambientale”. Uno sterminio non attraverso le armi, ma l’inquinamento e l’abbandono. Una questione non solo ecologica, ma di giustizia. Dalla biblioteca passò alla piazza: organizzò manifestazioni, scrisse appelli, parlò alle conferenze internazionali. Fondò, nel 1990, il Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) e, il 4 gennaio 1993, portò trecentomila persone a marciare pacificamente contro Shell e il governo nigeriano. La risposta fu brutale. Raid militari nei villaggi, arresti arbitrari, torture, esecuzioni sommarie.</p>\n<p>Finché, nel 1994, durante scontri interni alla comunità ogoni, quattro capi tradizionali vennero uccisi. Le circostanze erano oscure e le responsabilità mai chiarite, ma il regime militare di Sani Abacha aveva bisogno di un capro espiatorio. Chi meglio di Saro-Wiwa, il volto noto del movimento? Venne arrestato insieme ad altri otto attivisti del Mosop – gli “Ogoni Nine” –, accusati di essere i mandanti morali degli omicidi. Il processo fu una farsa: testimoni corrotti, difesa ostacolata, verdetto scontato. La comunità internazionale protestò, Nelson Mandela chiese clemenza, le Nazioni Unite minacciarono sanzioni. Tutto inutile. Il 10 novembre 1995 Saro-Wiwa e gli altri otto furono impiccati.</p>\n<p>La notizia scosse il mondo. La Nigeria fu sospesa dal Commonwealth. Shell fu accusata di complicità con il regime militare.</p>\n<p>Ma nel Delta del Niger cosa è cambiato davvero? Trent’anni dopo il bilancio è amaro. Nel 2011, l’Unep ha pubblicato un rapporto devastante sulla contaminazione del territorio ogoni, stimando che la bonifica completa avrebbe richiesto trent’anni e miliardi di dollari. Solo nel 2016 è stato avviato un progetto di bonifica (Hyprep): “Un fallimento totale”, secondo <em>The Independent</em>. Shell, dopo aver pagato diversi risarcimenti, ha operato nell’area fino al 2024, quando ha venduto le sue attività sulla terraferma a un consorzio locale. E nel giugno di quest’anno il presidente nigeriano Bola Tinubu ha concesso la grazia postuma agli Ogoni Nine. “Una grazia suggerisce che sia stato commesso un crimine. Ma quale crimine?”, si è chiesta Noo Saro-Wiwa, figlia di Ken.</p>\n<p>Il messaggio di suo padre era chiaro: <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/lultimo-rapporto-ipcc-giustizia-ambientale-e-giustizia-sociale\">non esiste giustizia sociale senza giustizia ambientale</a>; la lotta ambientale è una lotta per i diritti umani. Parole che hanno attraversato confini, ispirando movimenti ambientalisti dall’Indonesia all’Amazzonia, fino a farsi – altrove – citazioni. Ma citarlo non basta. La memoria da sola non libera. Ricordare Saro-Wiwa oggi non è un esercizio nostalgico o celebrativo. Significa chiedersi: noi, cosa stiamo facendo? Di fronte alle crisi ambientali del nostro tempo, di fronte alle ingiustizie ecologiche che si moltiplicano?</p>\n<p>“La storia è dalla nostra parte”, amava ripetere Saro-Wiwa. Non era ottimismo ingenuo, era fiducia nella capacità degli esseri umani di imparare dai propri errori. A giudicare con gli occhi di oggi, verrebbe da dire che si sbagliava. La sua eredità sopravvive, sì, ma come rimprovero, non come vittoria; per ora la storia non ci assolve. Gli errori del passato continuano a ripetersi, mentre corriamo verso il disastro ecologico con la stessa colpevole indifferenza che ha portato alla devastazione del Delta del Niger.</p>\n<p>Ma la storia non è finita, continua a chiedere risposte. E chissà se lentamente, dolorosamente, il mondo imparerà le lezioni che Saro-Wiwa ha pagato con la vita.</p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: A file picture dated 31 December 2011 shows a man covers his hands in crude oil during a protest against Shell after a oil spill from a Shell oil field in Bonga, Nigeria.

      "content": "<p>A dieci anni dalla firma dell’Accordo di Parigi (2015), la conferenza mondiale sul clima assume nel 2025 una connotazione più che simbolica: si apre a Belém, in Amazzonia, la 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference, meglio nota come Cop30, che rappresenta forse un bivio per la cooperazione internazionale, per la credibilità delle promesse climatiche e per la stessa idea di responsabilità globale.</p>\n<p><!--mitigo-paywall--></p>\n<p>Il luogo scelto, l’Amazzonia, è più di un simbolo – della natura che assorbe carbonio, della biodiversità che resiste, <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/cop-16-tra-luci-e-ombre\">delle comunità indigene</a> che portano memoria e sapienza – ma anche un termometro dell’inerzia globale e delle contraddizioni nella lotta al cambiamento climatico. Che la Cop30 si tenga in questa regione è chiaramente un messaggio politico. Eppure, il contesto politico internazionale non è favorevole. Se l’Accordo di Parigi aveva riacceso le speranze nel 2015, oggi quel fervore appare – almeno in parte – esaurito. Le temperature medie globali hanno accumulato un ritardo rispetto alle ambizioni originarie; gli impegni, ancora fragili; la fiducia reciproca, incrinata. In questo scenario, la Cop30 potrebbe essere un terreno di verifica: la domanda da porsi è se la cooperazione internazionale possa ancora reggere la prova dell’“azione” e della “responsabilità condivisa”.</p>\n<p>Alla vigilia di Belém, emergono almeno tre sfide che rischiano di compromettere il buon esito della conferenza. Il tema della transizione dai combustibili fossili tutt’altro che risolto. La questione della fiducia e del coordinamento internazionale: quando un attore centrale – si pensi agli Stati Uniti – decide di ritirarsi o di ridurre l’impegno, non è solo un gesto simbolico, ma un segnale che altera la logica del “gioco” tra paesi, mettendo a rischio lo scenario cooperativo. E, infine, la dimensione della giustizia climatica: le comunità vulnerabili chiedono risposte concrete, non solo promesse future, dando particolare peso alla just transition (“transizione giusta”). D’altro canto Belém potrebbe rivelarsi una conferenza sui generis: non servono più nuovi target, ma strumenti e pratiche che traducano gli impegni in risultati. <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/action-agenda\">Il documento Action Agenda</a> promosso dalla presidenza brasiliana indica sei assi strategici: energia-industria-trasporti; foreste-oceani-biodiversità; agricoltura-sistemi alimentari; resilienza-città-infrastrutture-acqua; sviluppo sociale-umano; abilitatori e acceleratori (finanza, tecnologia, capacità). Questa articolazione riflette la consapevolezza che la crisi climatica è sistemica e richiede risposte integrate, non segmentate, adesso.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, la rilevanza della Cop30 va oltre la costruzione di una nuova roadmap. Essa sarà la cartina di tornasole della distinzione tra due scenari possibili: l’uno in cui la cooperazione internazionale si rinsalda e produce progressi reali; l’altro in cui il disimpegno, l’inerzia e la frammentazione prevalgono, rendendo le promesse un esercizio formale. In termini matematici, come in un gioco di coordinamento, quando un attore chiave si ritira o sceglie di non cooperare, l’intero sistema può deviare verso un equilibrio sub-ottimale, in cui tutti perdono pur di non rischiare da soli.</p>\n<p>È esattamente ciò che è accaduto con l’Accordo di Parigi. Nato nel 2015 per unire i paesi nella lotta contro il cambiamento climatico e contenere l’aumento della temperatura globale ben al di sotto dei 2° Celsius rispetto ai livelli preindustriali, l’accordo rappresentava un raro momento di convergenza politica. Ma quella fragile architettura multilaterale ha mostrato subito la sua vulnerabilità: la vittoria di Donald Trump e la successiva decisione di ritirare gli Stati Uniti dall’accordo hanno alterato la dinamica di cooperazione, producendo un effetto domino di incertezza e rinvio che ha pesato sugli obiettivi climatici globali. Essendo il secondo maggiore emettitore di gas serra al mondo, l’uscita degli Stati Uniti mina gli sforzi internazionali per ridurre le emissioni e contrastare il cambiamento climatico. L’amministrazione Trump ha dato priorità alla produzione di combustibili fossili e ha smantellato numerose regolamentazioni ambientali, complicando ulteriormente il percorso verso il raggiungimento dei target dell’accordo.</p>\n<p>L’approccio dell’amministrazione Trump alle relazioni internazionali – in particolare il suo impegno in una guerra commerciale con la Cina e l’Unione europea – ha rappresentato un più ampio arretramento dal multilateralismo. Questa attitudine, esemplificata proprio dalla decisione di abbandonare l’Accordo di Parigi, segna un passaggio dal coordinamento internazionale all’unilateralismo. In questo clima politico, la cooperazione non è stata solo accantonata, ma spesso rappresentata come segno di debolezza.</p>\n<p>Eppure, la cooperazione non è soltanto un imperativo morale, ma un elemento fondamentale del progresso – soprattutto quando si tratta di affrontare sfide condivise come quella climatica. In un recente articolo pubblicato su <em>The Conversation</em>, Rebekkah Markey-Towler <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-has-withdrawn-the-us-from-the-paris-agreement-heres-why-thats-not-such-a-bad-thing-248109\">ha sostenuto</a> che l’uscita degli Stati Uniti, piuttosto che compromettere definitivamente la lotta al cambiamento climatico, potrebbe consentire ad altri paesi di agire più liberamente per ridurre le emissioni. Tuttavia, il Global Stocktake del 2023 dell’Unep ha rivelato che gli sforzi attuali restano insufficienti a raggiungere gli obiettivi di lungo termine dell’Accordo di Parigi: le proiezioni indicano un possibile aumento della temperatura compreso tra 2,5 e 2,9°C rispetto ai livelli preindustriali entro la fine del secolo. L’uscita degli Stati Uniti potrebbe quindi non rappresentare affatto una buona notizia, proprio a causa degli effetti di imitazione e retroazione che potrebbe generare.</p>\n<p>E nonostante i maggiori impegni assunti da diversi paesi, il ritmo dei progressi rimane inadeguato. Questi risultati sottolineano l’urgente necessità di una cooperazione globale rafforzata, di politiche più incisive e di obiettivi più ambiziosi. Il ritiro statunitense esercita una crescente pressione sugli altri paesi affinché intensifichino i propri sforzi di mitigazione, alterando l’equilibrio delle responsabilità condivise e complicando l’impresa collettiva di conseguire i traguardi dell’accordo. Per evitare gli effetti più gravi del cambiamento climatico, sono richieste azioni immediate e decisive.</p>\n<p>In un recente <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5181167\">lavoro</a>, insieme a Giorgos Galanis (Queen Mary University of London) e a Ben Tippet (King’s College of London), abbiamo mostrato che le azioni nazionali generano effetti di secondo ordine: una forma di pressione fra i pari (peer pressure). Tali effetti sono intuitivi se si considera l’azione climatica come un gioco di coordinamento. Pensare all’azione climatica in termini di teoria dei giochi è utile perché evidenzia come gli sforzi di un paese dipendano da ciò che fanno gli altri. Immaginiamo, per esempio, un gioco del cervo (Stag Hunt) tra due paesi, A e B. Ognuno può scegliere tra due strategie: adottare politiche climatiche ambiziose (cacciare il cervo) oppure mantenere lo status quo (cacciare il coniglio). Se entrambi scelgono l’azione ambiziosa, ottengono benefici comuni – un ambiente più sano, uno sviluppo sostenibile. Ma se solo uno dei due agisce sostiene costi elevati senza ottenere i benefici completi, mentre l’altro fa il free rider. Se nessuno agisce, entrambi subiscono gli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico. Il gioco presenta quindi due possibili equilibri (di Nash): uno di cooperazione e benessere reciproco, e uno di inerzia e danno condiviso. Nella realtà, però, i paesi affrontano vincoli differenti e possiedono preferenze eterogenee, influenzate da fattori politici ed economici. Queste differenze possono essere considerate come bias (distorsioni) positivi o negativi che condizionano l’evoluzione delle iniziative globali sul clima. Noi crediamo che tener conto di tali bias può modificare in modo sostanziale la traiettoria degli sforzi climatici globali. Attualmente, i livelli di impegno dei vari paesi sono fortemente influenzati dalla partecipazione o meno degli Stati Uniti all’Accordo di Parigi. Se gli Stati Uniti si ritirano, i paesi che non hanno un forte orientamento a favore di misure climatiche potrebbero decidere di non agire. Questo, a sua volta, può innescare una catena di astensioni che ci spinge verso il “cattivo equilibrio” di non-cooperazione. E tale effetto negativo, derivante dal ritiro statunitense, risulta ancora più marcato se si considerano le reti politiche ed economiche internazionali, che amplificano l’influenza politica globale degli Stati Uniti.</p>\n<p>Anche se l’impatto concreto del disimpegno americano sugli indicatori di emissione non è immediatamente visibile, gli effetti politici e simbolici di “pressione tra pari” sono già evidenti. Un sondaggio condotto prima delle elezioni americane da Undp e Università di Oxford in 77 paesi – che rappresentano l’87% della popolazione mondiale – mostrava un ampio sostegno popolare per l’azione contro il cambiamento climatico. Tuttavia, dopo l’avvio della seconda amministrazione Trump, il consenso politico per partiti che minimizzano la questione climatica è in crescita, in particolare in Europa. E data la stretta connessione politica ed economica con gli Stati Uniti, è prevedibile che le politiche americane possano rafforzare il sostegno a posizioni anti-ambientaliste anche altrove. Se già prima il raggiungimento degli obiettivi climatici era difficile, dopo l’allontanamento americano dall’Accordo di Parigi appare quasi improbabile.</p>\n<p>In un mondo in cui le grandi potenze – come gli Stati Uniti – tendono sempre più a privilegiare interessi nazionali di breve periodo, come accaduto durante l’era Trump in campo commerciale e ambientale, lo sforzo collettivo necessario per affrontare la crisi climatica diventa estremamente fragile.</p>\n<p>Nelle democrazie, tuttavia, la pressione tra pari non proviene soltanto dalla comunità internazionale, ma anche dai cittadini che eleggono i propri governi. Rimane quindi la possibilità che i governi presenti e futuri tengano conto delle preferenze popolari per un’azione climatica decisa, rendendo ciò che oggi appare improbabile ancora possibile — una possibilità che poggia, in ultima analisi, sulla forza della cooperazione.</p>\n<p>Alla vigilia della Cop30, la sfida è ricostruire ciò che un decennio di disillusione ha eroso: la fiducia che la cooperazione possa produrre risultati concreti. L’Accordo di Parigi non è in crisi per mancanza di strumenti, ma per deficit di volontà collettiva. Le potenze emergenti, dal Brasile all’India, rivendicano un ruolo più autonomo; gli Stati Uniti oscillano tra impegno e disimpegno; l’Europa, pur dichiarando ambizione, mostra segni di stanchezza politica. Eppure, nel momento in cui il mondo guarda a Belém, resta aperta la possibilità che il Sud globale diventi il nuovo motore di una cooperazione rinnovata, più equa e meno centrata sull’Occidente. Se la Cop30 riuscirà a invertire la logica del sospetto e della competizione, allora l’Accordo di Parigi potrà ancora essere salvato. Perché, come ricorda il biologo Martin Nowak, la cooperazione non è un ideale ingenuo, ma la condizione stessa dell’evoluzione e della sopravvivenza collettiva.</p>\n<h6>CREDITI FOTO: Aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest, near Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Amazon_River#/media/File:Amazon_CIAT_(2).jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Palmer/CIAT | Wikimedia Commons</a></h6>\n<p>L'articolo <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net/belem-amazzonia-cop30/\">Apre la Cop30, dieci anni dopo l&#8217;Accordo di Parigi</a> proviene da <a href=\"https://www.micromega.net\">MicroMega</a>.</p>",

I 26 distretti di Corte d&#8217;Appello italiani (più 3 sezioni distaccate a Bolzano, Sassari e Taranto), individuati dall&#8217;<a href=\"https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2008-03-18;48!vig=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">articolo 11 della legge 48/2008</a>, rappresentano l&#8217;ossatura del <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/contrasto-cybercrime/\">sistema italiano di contrasto alla criminalità informatica</a>, un&#8217;architettura organizzativa che ricalca il modello già consolidato per i reati di terrorismo e criminalità organizzata ma che deve confrontarsi con sfide investigative di natura radicalmente diversa.</p>\n<p>La scelta legislativa di concentrare a livello distrettuale la competenza sui reati informatici – introducendo il comma 3-quinquies dell&#8217;articolo 51 del Codice di Procedura Penale – nasce da una consapevolezza: il cybercrime non conosce confini territoriali e richiede una specializzazione investigativa che non può essere frammentata su base provinciale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/pubblicazioni/ransomware-innovazione-e-redditivita-del-cyber-crime/\">Un attacco ransomware</a> contro un ospedale lombardo può essere orchestrato da un gruppo criminale con base in Estonia, utilizzando server compromessi in Asia e infrastrutture di pagamento in criptovalute registrate in paradisi fiscali caraibici. La Procura territorialmente competente per il luogo in cui si è verificato l&#8217;evento criminoso deve poter disporre di competenze tecniche e reti investigative che trascendono la dimensione locale, ed è proprio questa capacità di coordinamento sovraprovinciale che giustifica la competenza distrettuale.</p>\n<h2>La genesi normativa: dalla Convenzione di Budapest all&#8217;articolo 51 comma 3-quinquies CPP</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;introduzione della competenza distrettuale per i reati informatici non è stata immediata né priva di difficoltà applicative. La legge 18 marzo 2008, n. 48, nel ratificare la <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list?module=treaty-detail&amp;treatynum=185\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Convenzione di Budapest</a> (approvata il 23 novembre 2001 ed entrata in vigore il 1° luglio 2004), <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/il-potenziamento-della-cooperazione-internazionale-in-materia-di-cybercrime-e-prove-elettroniche/\">ha modificato l&#8217;assetto procedurale italiano</a> con una tecnica legislativa che inizialmente ha generato incertezze interpretative. L&#8217;articolo 11 della legge 48/2008 ha introdotto il comma 3-quinquies all&#8217;articolo 51 CPP, attribuendo al pubblico ministero presso il tribunale del capoluogo del distretto di Corte d&#8217;Appello la competenza per i procedimenti relativi ai delitti commessi mediante l&#8217;impiego di tecnologie informatiche o telematiche.</p>\n<p>La norma, entrata in vigore il 5 aprile 2008, tuttavia non aveva inizialmente previsto il simmetrico adeguamento della competenza del Giudice per le Indagini Preliminari, generando un&#8217;asimmetria procedurale che la Corte di Cassazione ha dovuto risolvere attraverso un&#8217;interpretazione costituzionalmente orientata. Solo con la legge n. 125 del 24 luglio 2008, attraverso l&#8217;inserimento del comma 1-quater all&#8217;articolo 328 CPP, si è completato il quadro normativo, attribuendo anche al GIP distrettuale la competenza sugli atti relativi alle indagini preliminari per i reati informatici.</p>\n<p>Questa vicenda normativa evidenzia un problema ricorrente nella legislazione italiana in materia di cybercrime: l&#8217;urgenza di adeguare l&#8217;ordinamento a fenomeni criminali in rapida evoluzione si scontra spesso con la necessità di garantire la coerenza sistematica del Codice di Procedura Penale. Il risultato sono interventi legislativi stratificati, emendamenti a emendamenti, disposizioni transitorie che rendono complessa l&#8217;attività interpretativa e applicativa da parte degli operatori del diritto.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;operatività delle Procure Distrettuali: tra specializzazione e frammentazione</h2>\n<p>Le Procure Distrettuali competenti per i reati informatici, presenti nei 26 capoluoghi di distretto di Corte d&#8217;Appello più le 3 sezioni distaccate, operano con livelli di specializzazione e dotazioni tecniche estremamente eterogenei. Le Procure di Milano, Roma, Napoli e Torino hanno sviluppato nel tempo pool di magistrati dedicati esclusivamente alla criminalità informatica, con competenze tecniche raffinate e rapporti consolidati con la Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni. Altre Procure Distrettuali, invece, affrontano i procedimenti per reati informatici all&#8217;interno dei tradizionali gruppi di lavoro, con magistrati che alternano indagini cyber a procedimenti di natura tradizionale.</p>\n<p>Questa disomogeneità non è solo questione di organizzazione interna ma riflette anche la diversa incidenza territoriale del fenomeno criminale. Le grandi aree metropolitane, con la concentrazione di infrastrutture digitali, data center, provider di servizi cloud e imprese tecnologiche, sono naturalmente epicentri di criminalità informatica. Una frode informatica perpetrata attraverso un server ubicato a Milano genererà competenza della Procura Distrettuale milanese, indipendentemente dal luogo di residenza delle vittime o degli autori del reato. Questo criterio di collegamento territoriale – basato sul luogo in cui si trova il sistema informatico attraverso cui il reato è stato commesso – genera una concentrazione di procedimenti presso alcune Procure Distrettuali, amplificando le disparità di carico di lavoro e di specializzazione.</p>\n<p>La Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni, istituita nella forma attuale con decreto del ministero dell&#8217;Interno del 31 marzo 1998, con i suoi 18 Centri Operativi per la Sicurezza Cibernetica (COSC) distribuiti nei principali capoluoghi di regione e le 82 Sezioni Operative per la Sicurezza Cibernetica (SOSC), rappresenta il braccio operativo naturale delle Procure Distrettuali.</p>\n<p>La specialità della Polizia di Stato, posta oggi alle dipendenze della Direzione Centrale per la <a href=\"https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/40766685ed4beab2126065878\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Polizia Scientifica e la Sicurezza Cibernetica</a> (divenuta operativa nel febbraio 2024), dispone di competenze tecniche avanzate in digital forensics, analisi di malware, tracciamento di transazioni in criptovalute, penetrazione di reti anonime. Il rapporto tra magistrati inquirenti e investigatori della Polizia Postale non è semplicemente di delega esecutiva, ma si configura come una collaborazione sinergica in cui la comprensione tecnica del fenomeno criminale informa le scelte strategiche dell&#8217;indagine, mentre la direzione giuridica garantisce la conformità procedurale e la utilizzabilità probatoria delle attività investigative.</p>\n<h2>Il Centro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche (CNAIPIC)</h2>\n<p>All&#8217;interno della Polizia Postale opera una struttura di particolare rilevanza strategica: il CNAIPIC, incaricato in via esclusiva della prevenzione e repressione dei crimini informatici che hanno per obiettivo le infrastrutture informatizzate di natura critica e di rilevanza nazionale. Il Centro opera attraverso tre direttrici principali: intelligence per la raccolta dati e informazioni utili alla prevenzione, attraverso monitoraggio costante della rete e rapporti di collaborazione con organismi di polizia nazionali e internazionali; analisi per l&#8217;approfondimento comparativo dei dati raccolti e la predisposizione di rapporti previsionali sull&#8217;evoluzione della minaccia; risposta investigativa al verificarsi di eventi criminali in danno delle infrastrutture critiche, avvalendosi della rete territoriale dei Centri Operativi e delle Sezioni Operative della Polizia Postale.</p>\n<p>Il CNAIPIC mantiene un punto di contatto operativo 24/7 dedicato all&#8217;interscambio informativo con i gestori delle infrastrutture critiche, costituendo un anello di congiunzione tra la dimensione preventiva – di competenza dell&#8217;Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale (ACN) – e quella repressiva di competenza giudiziaria. Quando un attacco informatico colpisce un&#8217;infrastruttura critica, la tempestività della risposta è cruciale non solo per mitigare i danni immediati ma anche per cristallizzare le prove digitali prima che l&#8217;attaccante possa cancellare le proprie tracce o che la volatilità intrinseca dei dati ne determini la perdita. In questi scenari, il CNAIPIC opera in stretto coordinamento con le Procure Distrettuali competenti, fornendo supporto tecnico immediato e garantendo la corretta acquisizione forense delle evidenze.</p>\n<h2>La sinergia pubblico-privato: ACN, CSIRT Italia e l&#8217;ecosistema della cybersecurity</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;efficacia dell&#8217;azione delle Procure Distrettuali nel contrasto al cybercrime dipende in misura crescente dalla capacità di integrare la dimensione repressiva con quella preventiva e di collaborare con gli attori del settore privato che gestiscono le infrastrutture digitali del Paese. L&#8217;Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale, istituita con <a href=\"https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2021/06/14/21G00098/sg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decreto-legge n. 82 del 14 giugno 2021</a> e divenuta operativa nello stesso anno, rappresenta l&#8217;autorità nazionale con compiti di prevenzione, monitoraggio e coordinamento in materia di sicurezza cibernetica.</p>\n<p>All&#8217;interno dell&#8217;ACN opera il CSIRT Italia (Computer Security Incident Response Team), la squadra nazionale di risposta agli incidenti informatici che monitora costantemente le minacce cyber, emette alert e bollettini di sicurezza, coordina la gestione tecnica degli incidenti che coinvolgono soggetti pubblici e privati. Il CSIRT Italia, trasferito il 16 settembre 2021 dal Dipartimento Informazioni per la Sicurezza alla neonata ACN, costituisce un ponte essenziale tra la dimensione tecnica della sicurezza informatica e quella giuridico-investigativa.</p>\n<p>Quando un&#8217;azienda subisce un attacco informatico, la prima segnalazione avviene spesso al CSIRT, che fornisce supporto tecnico immediato per il contenimento e la remediation. Parallelamente, se l&#8217;evento costituisce reato, il CSIRT facilita il raccordo con la Polizia Postale e la Procura Distrettuale competente, garantendo che le attività di ripristino dei sistemi non compromettano l&#8217;integrità delle prove digitali necessarie per l&#8217;azione penale.</p>\n<p>Questa collaborazione pubblico-privato solleva delicati interrogativi sulla condivisione delle informazioni e sulla tutela dei segreti aziendali. Le imprese che subiscono attacchi informatici sono spesso riluttanti a denunciare l&#8217;accaduto per timore di danni reputazionali, perdita di fiducia da parte dei clienti, sanzioni da parte delle autorità di vigilanza per inadeguatezza delle misure di sicurezza.</p>\n<p>La normativa sulla data retention, le direttive europee NIS e NIS2 sulla sicurezza delle reti e dei sistemi informativi, il GDPR con i suoi obblighi di notifica dei data breach, hanno progressivamente ridotto gli spazi di discrezionalità delle imprese, rendendo obbligatoria la segnalazione di determinate tipologie di incidenti. Tuttavia, la frontiera tra obbligo di segnalazione e volontaria collaborazione investigativa rimane sfumata, e le Procure Distrettuali devono spesso bilanciare l&#8217;esigenza di acquisire tempestivamente informazioni con la necessità di non compromettere i rapporti fiduciari con il settore privato.</p>\n<h2>Le sfide operative: carenze di organico, obsolescenza tecnologica, tempi processuali</h2>\n<p>Nonostante l&#8217;avanzamento normativo e l&#8217;istituzione di strutture specializzate, le Procure Distrettuali per i reati informatici affrontano sfide operative di straordinaria complessità. La carenza di magistrati specializzati è un problema strutturale: formare un pubblico ministero competente in materia di criminalità informatica richiede anni di esperienza sul campo, aggiornamento tecnico continuo, capacità di dialogare con consulenti tecnici e periti forensi. Il turnover dei magistrati, determinato dalla progressione di carriera e dai trasferimenti, rende difficile consolidare competenze di pool che richiederebbero continuità pluriennale.</p>\n<p>Sul versante delle dotazioni tecnologiche, molte Procure Distrettuali operano con strumenti informatici che appaiono anacronistici se confrontati con le tecnologie utilizzate dalla criminalità. I laboratori di digital forensics richiedono investimenti significativi in hardware e software specializzati, formazione del personale tecnico, aggiornamento costante per fronteggiare l&#8217;evoluzione delle tecniche di occultamento delle prove. Le sale server delle Procure, quando esistono, spesso non dispongono degli standard di sicurezza che sarebbero richiesti per la custodia di prove digitali relative a reati di particolare gravità. Il rischio di compromissione dei dati acquisiti, sia per inadeguatezza delle misure di protezione sia per errori nella gestione della catena di custodia, è una preoccupazione costante.</p>\n<p>I tempi processuali rappresentano un&#8217;ulteriore criticità. Un&#8217;indagine per criminalità informatica può richiedere mesi o anni per essere completata: l&#8217;identificazione degli autori attraverso l&#8217;analisi dei log di connessione, l&#8217;ottenimento di rogatorie internazionali per l&#8217;acquisizione di dati conservati all&#8217;estero, la decrittazione di comunicazioni cifrate, l&#8217;analisi forense di dispositivi sequestrati contenenti terabyte di dati. Nel frattempo, gli strumenti utilizzati per commettere il reato evolvono, le piattaforme criminali si spostano, gli autori cambiano identità digitale. Quando un procedimento giunge finalmente a dibattimento, non è raro che le tecnologie oggetto dell&#8217;indagine siano ormai obsolete e che le dinamiche del mercato criminale si siano completamente trasformate.</p>\n<h2>Il coordinamento tra Procure: la Procura Nazionale Antimafia e Antiterrorismo</h2>\n<p>La frammentazione territoriale delle competenze, pur mitigata dalla concentrazione distrettuale, può generare problemi di coordinamento quando un&#8217;organizzazione criminale opera attraverso cellule dislocate in più distretti o quando una piattaforma criminale online serve utenti su tutto il territorio nazionale. La Direzione Nazionale Antimafia e Antiterrorismo (DNA), tradizionalmente competente per il coordinamento delle indagini su criminalità organizzata e terrorismo, ha progressivamente esteso il proprio raggio d&#8217;azione anche a fenomeni di cybercrime organizzato, in particolare quando questi si intersecano con attività di riciclaggio, traffico di stupefacenti, estorsioni tramite ransomware.</p>\n<p>Recenti proposte legislative hanno ipotizzato l&#8217;ampliamento ulteriore della competenza delle Direzioni Distrettuali Antimafia ai reati di estorsione informatica, riconoscendo che i gruppi criminali che operano attacchi ransomware presentano caratteristiche organizzative e capacità offensive comparabili a quelle della criminalità organizzata tradizionale. Questa evoluzione segna un cambiamento di paradigma: il cybercrime non è più percepito come una categoria criminale a sé stante, tecnicamente complessa ma sostanzialmente diversa dalla criminalità &#8220;fisica&#8221;, ma come una delle molteplici manifestazioni dell&#8217;azione di gruppi criminali che utilizzano indifferentemente strumenti digitali e tradizionali per perseguire i propri obiettivi di profitto illecito.</p>\n<h2>Casi paradigmatici: dall&#8217;indagine al dibattimento</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;esperienza operativa delle Procure Distrettuali offre una casistica ricchissima di indagini che hanno fatto scuola, stabilendo precedenti giurisprudenziali e affinando metodologie investigative. Le operazioni contro i marketplace del darknet – piattaforme anonime dove si commerciano droghe, armi, documenti falsi, dati rubati – hanno richiesto tecniche investigative ibride: infiltrazioni sotto copertura negli ambienti criminali digitali, analisi del <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/cybersecurity-video/blockchain-cripto/\">blockchain per tracciare i flussi finanziari in criptovalute</a>, collaborazione con agenzie internazionali per smantellare simultaneamente i server in più giurisdizioni.</p>\n<p>Gli attacchi ransomware contro ospedali e pubbliche amministrazioni hanno posto problemi etici oltre che investigativi: quando un ospedale vede paralizzati i propri sistemi informatici con conseguente impossibilità di accedere alle cartelle cliniche dei pazienti, la priorità immediata è il ripristino dei servizi essenziali, anche a costo di pagare il riscatto. Le Procure Distrettuali si sono trovate a dover bilanciare l&#8217;esigenza investigativa di non compromettere le prove con la necessità di salvaguardare vite umane, sviluppando protocolli di intervento che distinguono tra acquisizione forense immediata di elementi volatili e analisi approfondita differita a quando l&#8217;emergenza sanitaria è superata.</p>\n<p>Le frodi informatiche transnazionali, dalle truffe mediante phishing bancario alle frodi nelle piattaforme di e-commerce, hanno evidenziato i limiti degli strumenti investigativi tradizionali quando gli autori operano dall&#8217;estero e i server utilizzati si trovano in giurisdizioni non cooperative. In questi casi, l&#8217;unica via percorribile è spesso la collaborazione con i gestori privati delle piattaforme (provider di servizi email, social network, sistemi di pagamento) che, pur non essendo obbligati a collaborare con autorità giudiziarie straniere, possono volontariamente fornire informazioni o disattivare account utilizzati per attività criminali.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;integrazione con il sistema EPPO: competenze concorrenti e coordinamento europeo</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;operatività della Procura Europea (EPPO) <a href=\"https://procura-eppo.giustizia.it/it/chi_siamo.page#:~:text=La%20Procura%20Europea%20(EPPO)%20%C3%A8,gli%20interessi%20finanziari%20dell&#039;UE.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dal 1° giugno 2021</a> ha introdotto un ulteriore livello di complessità nel panorama delle competenze investigative. I reati informatici che ledono gli interessi finanziari dell&#8217;Unione Europea – frodi ai danni dei fondi comunitari commesse attraverso piattaforme digitali, manipolazione di sistemi informatici per ottenere indebiti finanziamenti europei – rientrano nella competenza dell&#8217;EPPO e vengono gestiti dai Procuratori Europei Delegati (PED) operanti in Italia.</p>\n<p>La competenza concorrente tra Procure Distrettuali nazionali ed EPPO richiede meccanismi di coordinamento per evitare duplicazioni investigative o, peggio, interferenze reciproche. I protocolli di collaborazione prevedono che, quando un reato presenta profili di competenza sia nazionale sia europea, le autorità inquirenti si consultino per definire quale sia il forum più appropriato per condurre l&#8217;indagine. In questo contesto, le Procure Distrettuali italiane portano la propria esperienza consolidata nel contrasto al cybercrime, mentre l&#8217;EPPO offre strumenti di cooperazione giudiziaria semplificati e accesso diretto a informazioni detenute da autorità di altri Stati membri.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive di riforma: verso una Procura Nazionale Cyber?</h2>\n<p>Il dibattito sulla riorganizzazione del sistema delle Procure Distrettuali per i reati informatici si articola su due direttrici principali. Da un lato, vi è chi propugna un&#8217;ulteriore concentrazione delle competenze, ipotizzando l&#8217;istituzione di una Procura Nazionale Cyber sul modello della Direzione Nazionale Antimafia, che coordini le indagini più complesse e garantisca uniformità di approccio investigativo su tutto il territorio nazionale. Questa proposta si scontra con la resistenza di chi teme un&#8217;eccessiva centralizzazione che priverebbe le realtà territoriali della capacità di rispondere tempestivamente a fenomeni criminali locali e che rischierebbe di congestionare un&#8217;unica struttura con competenza su una materia – la criminalità informatica – che per vastità e articolazione non è comparabile alle fattispecie tradizionalmente gestite dalle Procure nazionali.</p>\n<p>Dall&#8217;altro lato, vi è chi sostiene la necessità di un potenziamento delle Procure Distrettuali esistenti piuttosto che la creazione di nuove strutture: incremento degli organici con magistrati specializzati, investimenti significativi in dotazioni tecnologiche, formazione continua obbligatoria non solo per i magistrati ma per tutto il personale amministrativo e tecnico che opera nelle Procure. Questa visione privilegia un modello distribuito ma fortemente interconnesso, dove ogni Procura Distrettuale dispone delle competenze essenziali ma può attivare rapidamente meccanismi di mutuo supporto quando affronta indagini che eccedono le proprie capacità.</p>\n<p>La verità probabilmente risiede in una sintesi: mantenere la competenza distrettuale come livello ordinario di gestione delle indagini per reati informatici, rafforzandola significativamente in termini di risorse umane e tecnologiche; istituire un centro di coordinamento nazionale – non necessariamente con funzioni inquirenti dirette – che funga da hub per lo scambio di best practices, la gestione di banche dati investigative condivise, il coordinamento di indagini multi-distrettuali, la formazione specialistica; sviluppare protocolli standardizzati per l&#8217;acquisizione e l&#8217;analisi forense che garantiscano uniformità metodologica pur nel rispetto delle specificità territoriali.</p>\n<h2>Conclusioni: l&#8217;equilibrio tra specializzazione tecnica e garanzie processuali</h2>\n<p>Le Procure Distrettuali per i reati informatici incarnano una delle sfide più complesse del diritto processuale penale contemporaneo: conciliare l&#8217;esigenza di un&#8217;altissima specializzazione tecnica con la necessaria salvaguardia delle garanzie procedurali che costituiscono il fondamento dello Stato di diritto. Un magistrato che indaga su un attacco informatico deve possedere competenze che spaziano dall&#8217;informatica forense alla crittografia, dalla comprensione delle architetture cloud all&#8217;analisi delle transazioni blockchain, ma deve al contempo rimanere saldamente ancorato ai principi del giusto processo, alla presunzione di innocenza, al diritto di difesa.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;architettura investigativa italiana, con i suoi 26 distretti di Corte d&#8217;Appello (più 3 sezioni distaccate), la Polizia Postale, il CNAIPIC, la sinergia con ACN e CSIRT Italia, rappresenta un sistema in continua evoluzione, che deve costantemente adattarsi a un panorama criminale caratterizzato da un&#8217;innovazione tecnologica vorticosa. Gli autori di reati informatici sviluppano nuove tecniche di attacco, sfruttano vulnerabilità appena scoperte, si spostano verso piattaforme emergenti con una velocità che rende ogni procedura investigativa potenzialmente obsoleta prima ancora di essere stata pienamente implementata.</p>\n<p>In questo contesto di perenne mutamento, ciò che deve rimanere costante è l&#8217;impegno a garantire che l&#8217;efficacia investigativa non sia perseguita a scapito della legalità processuale. Le prove digitali, per quanto tecnicamente inoppugnabili, devono essere acquisite nel rispetto delle norme sulla perquisizione e sul sequestro; le intercettazioni mediante captatori informatici devono sottostare a limiti costituzionali stringenti; l&#8217;accesso a dati conservati all&#8217;estero deve passare attraverso gli strumenti di cooperazione giudiziaria internazionale. Solo preservando questo equilibrio – difficile, precario, sempre da riconquistare – le Procure Distrettuali possono assolvere alla loro funzione di tutela della legalità nel cyberspazio senza tradire i principi fondamentali del processo penale democratico.</p>",

La sicurezza dei satelliti non è più un problema teorico: è diventata priorità strategica per la difesa nazionale, la resilienza economica e la protezione delle infrastrutture critiche di ogni nazione avanzata.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;alba del 24 febbraio 2022 ha segnato uno spartiacque nella storia della cybersecurity spaziale. Mentre i carri armati russi attraversavano il confine ucraino e i missili colpivano le prime città, un attacco cyber ai satelliti si consumava centinaia di chilometri sopra le nostre teste. La <a href=\"https://www.viasat.com/perspectives/corporate/2022/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rete satellitare commerciale KA-SAT di Viasat</a> subiva un attacco informatico devastante che avrebbe compromesso <a href=\"https://cyberconflicts.cyberpeaceinstitute.org/law-and-policy/cases/viasat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">circa 30.000 terminali satellitari</a>, dimostrando che la cybersecurity spaziale era diventata arma tattica coordinata con operazioni militari convenzionali.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;attacco KA-SAT: anatomia della prima guerra cyber spaziale documentata</h2>\n<p>Nelle prime ore del mattino del 24 febbraio 2022 – mentre i primi carri armati russi attraversavano il confine – la sicurezza dei satelliti commerciali veniva violata con precisione chirurgica. Secondo quanto <a href=\"https://www.viasat.com/perspectives/corporate/2022/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">riportato ufficialmente da Viasat</a> nei suoi comunicati tecnici, in quei minuti cruciali vennero rilevati «alti volumi di traffico malevolo provenienti da diversi modem e dispositivi dei clienti fisicamente localizzati in Ucraina». Questo attacco denial of service mirato rappresentava un&#8217;evoluzione senza precedenti nelle minacce cyber spaziali.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;attacco ai satelliti KA-SAT, successivamente <a href=\"https://eurepoc.eu/publication/major-cyber-incident-ka-sat-9a/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attribuito con elevata confidenza</a> dalle agenzie di intelligence occidentali al gruppo Sandworm del servizio di intelligence militare russo GRU, ha dimostrato come la cybersecurity spaziale sia diventata componente essenziale della guerra moderna. Come documentato dall&#8217;Agenzia dell&#8217;Unione Europea per la Cybersecurity (ENISA) nel suo rapporto Space Threat Landscape 2025 sulle minacce alle infrastrutture spaziali, si è trattato della prima dimostrazione operativa su scala strategica che i sistemi satellitari commerciali possono essere trasformati in obiettivi militari.</p>\n<p>La protezione delle infrastrutture spaziali cessava di essere problema teorico per diventare necessità operativa immediata. Le conseguenze dell&#8217;inadeguata sicurezza informatica dei satelliti si sono manifestate con effetti a cascata su scala continentale, evidenziando l&#8217;urgenza di investimenti massicci in difesa cyber orbitale.</p>\n<h2>Impatti transnazionali: quando le vulnerabilità satellitari colpiscono l&#8217;Europa</h2>\n<p>Le conseguenze dell&#8217;attacco cyber ai satelliti si sono propagate ben oltre i confini dell&#8217;Ucraina, rivelando l&#8217;interconnessione critica delle infrastrutture spaziali europee. In Germania, <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">oltre 5.800 turbine eoliche hanno perso connettività</a> di monitoraggio remoto, paralizzando capacità significative di generazione eolica e dimostrando come la <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/dominio-spaziale/\">cybersecurity spaziale</a> impatti direttamente sulla sicurezza energetica nazionale. In Italia, Polonia, Francia e Grecia, servizi critici dipendenti da comunicazioni satellitari sicure hanno sperimentato interruzioni significative, con migliaia di utenti disconnessi per settimane.</p>\n<p>Il danno economico e l&#8217;impatto totale considerando interruzioni di servizio, perdite di produttività, danni reputazionali e investimenti straordinari in sicurezza secondo le analisi dell&#8217;incidente sono stati considerevoli. Questi numeri sottolineano l&#8217;urgenza di investimenti sostanziali in protezione cyber per satelliti e resilienza delle costellazioni orbitali.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;impatto strategico più significativo risiede nella dimostrazione che lo spazio non è più dominio neutrale. La sicurezza spaziale è diventata questione di sovranità nazionale. Come evidenziato dal Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) nel suo rapporto annuale sulle minacce spaziali, l&#8217;attacco KA-SAT rappresenta spartiacque nella storia della difesa cyber spaziale: per la prima volta, un attacco informatico a satelliti veniva sincronizzato precisamente con operazioni militari cinetiche, rivelando integrazione strategica tra domini fisici e digitali.</p>\n<h2>Cronologia delle minacce cyber spaziali: dall&#8217;emergenza alla normalità</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;attacco KA-SAT non è evento isolato ma culmine di un&#8217;escalation progressiva delle minacce alla cybersecurity spaziale documentata negli ultimi due decenni. Comprendere questa cronologia è essenziale per sviluppare strategie efficaci di protezione satellitare.</p>\n<p>Nel 1998, secondo <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2021/february/asat-goes-cyber\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alcune analisi</a>, il satellite tedesco ROSAT avrebbe subito un presunto attacco informatico che ne modificò l&#8217;orientamento causando perdita di controllo. Mentre permane dibattito sulla natura dell&#8217;incidente, è documentato che si verificò un&#8217;intrusione cyber ai sistemi del Goddard Space Flight Center che controllava il satellite nello stesso periodo. Questo evento rappresentava un primo segnale d&#8217;allarme che la sicurezza dei sistemi spaziali richiedeva attenzione specifica. Il satellite rientrò incontrollatamente nell&#8217;atmosfera nel 2011, testimonianza tangibile dei rischi della cybersecurity spaziale inadeguata.</p>\n<p>Durante le operazioni NATO nei Balcani, i satelliti militari britannici Skynet subirono tentativi di jamming e interferenze elettroniche attribuite a fonti ostili, segnando la transizione verso forme più sofisticate di attacco elettronico ai satelliti.</p>\n<p>Gli anni 2007 e 2008 rappresentano momento critico nell&#8217;evoluzione delle minacce cyber ai satelliti. <a href=\"https://www.space.com/13423-hackers-government-satellites.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I satelliti di osservazione terrestre Terra e Landsat della NASA</a> subirono intrusioni informatiche documentate, durante le quali gli attaccanti ottennero accesso ai sistemi di comando. Il satellite Landsat-7 subì interferenze per oltre 12 minuti in due occasioni distinte (ottobre 2007 e luglio 2008), mentre il satellite Terra AM-1 fu compromesso per 2 minuti nel giugno 2008 e per 9 minuti nell&#8217;ottobre dello stesso anno. Durante quest&#8217;ultimo incidente, <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/idealab/nasa-confirms-suspicious-events-in-satellite-hacking-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gli attaccanti raggiunsero tutti i passaggi necessari per comandare il satellite</a>, pur non eseguendo comandi. La NASA confermò pubblicamente gli incidenti, segnando una delle prime ammissioni ufficiali che la cybersecurity spaziale affrontava minacce concrete da attori ostili sofisticati.</p>\n<p>Nel 2014, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/chinese-hack-us-weather-systems-satellite-network/2014/11/12/bef1206a-68e9-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">le stazioni meteorologiche satellitari della NOAA</a> (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) vennero compromesse in settembre e ottobre, causando interruzioni dei servizi meteorologici critici per aviazione, navigazione e gestione emergenze. L&#8217;attacco dimostrò come la sicurezza delle infrastrutture spaziali civili impatti direttamente sulla sicurezza quotidiana dei cittadini, non solo su asset militari o di intelligence.</p>\n<p>La costellazione satellitare iraniana subì nel 2018 attacchi informatici multipli che compromisero comunicazioni e controllo, probabilmente condotti da attori statali nell&#8217;ambito delle tensioni geopolitiche mediorientali. Questi eventi evidenziarono come la cybersecurity spaziale fosse diventata strumento di pressione diplomatica e conflitto sotto soglia.</p>\n<h2>Mega-costellazioni e superficie di attacco esponenziale</h2>\n<p>Con l&#8217;avvento delle mega-costellazioni commerciali, le sfide alla cybersecurity spaziale si sono moltiplicate esponenzialmente. <a href=\"https://starlink.com/updates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink, la costellazione di SpaceX</a> che conta oltre 6.750 satelliti in orbita bassa (dato febbraio 2025), ha iniziato a subire <a href=\"https://www.space.com/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-cyber-defense-ukraine-invasion\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attacchi di jamming</a> e <a href=\"https://www.space.com/starlink-russian-cyberattacks-ramp-up-efforts-elon-musk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tentativi di cyberattacco</a> sistematici dal marzo 2022, intensificatisi drammaticamente con il supporto fornito alle forze armate ucraine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-starlink-resisted-hacking-attempts-russia-1705495\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk ha dichiarato pubblicamente</a> di dover respingere «attacchi cyber avanzati» e tentativi di jamming contro Starlink, confermando che la difesa dei satelliti commerciali era ormai teatro di confronto diretto tra potenze globali. <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/killnet-claims-attacks-against-starlink-whitehousegov-and-united-kingdom-websites/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nel novembre 2022, il gruppo russo Killnet</a> ha rivendicato attacchi DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) che hanno causato interruzioni temporanee del servizio. La sicurezza delle costellazioni Starlink è diventata <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_in_the_Russian-Ukrainian_War\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caso di studio</a> per l&#8217;intera industria spaziale sulla resilienza cyber orbitale.</p>\n<p>Nel 2023, il sistema GPS globale ha registrato segnalazioni crescenti di spoofing GPS e interferenze in diverse zone di conflitto, inclusi il Mar Nero e il Medio Oriente, con impatti documentati su aviazione civile e navigazione marittima. Aerei commerciali hanno riportato deviazioni improvvise della posizione GPS, navi hanno sperimentato coordinate falsificate, veicoli autonomi hanno subito malfunzionamenti. Questi incidenti dimostrano che la cybersecurity dei sistemi di navigazione satellitare non è più confinata al dominio militare, ma impatta direttamente la sicurezza dei trasporti civili.</p>\n<h2>Guerra ibrida spaziale: attori statali, privati e la rivoluzione della cybersecurity</h2>\n<p>Il conflitto in Ucraina ha rivelato una nuova dimensione del confronto militare dove la cybersecurity spaziale gioca ruolo centrale. Le infrastrutture satellitari sono sotto attacco costante da entrambe le parti: la rete Starlink subisce offensive da hacker legati alla Russia, mentre i satelliti russi affrontano pressioni da hacker ucraini e alleati occidentali. Questa situazione ha ridefinito il significato stesso di sicurezza spaziale, trasformandola da questione tecnica a dimensione strategica del confronto geopolitico.</p>\n<p>Per la prima volta nella storia, satelliti commerciali al servizio degli Stati partecipano attivamente alle operazioni militari sul campo, sfumando i confini tradizionali tra civile e militare che hanno a lungo guidato il diritto internazionale dei conflitti. Le aziende spaziali private forniscono oggi capacità C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) direttamente ai comandi militari, sollevando interrogativi complessi per la cybersecurity spaziale: se un&#8217;azienda privata fornisce servizi militari attraverso i propri satelliti, questi asset diventano obiettivi legittimi? Chi è responsabile della loro protezione cyber?</p>\n<p>Starlink fornisce connettività crittografata alle forze armate ucraine, permettendo comunicazioni resilienti anche in zone dove le infrastrutture terrestri sono state distrutte. La sicurezza delle comunicazioni satellitari militari dipende ora da operatori commerciali. Maxar Technologies e Planet Labs forniscono immagini satellitari ad alta risoluzione utilizzate per pianificare operazioni offensive, documentare crimini di guerra e valutare danni da bombardamenti. HawkEye 360 traccia le emissioni radiofrequenza per localizzare sistemi radar, stazioni radio e veicoli militari avversari.</p>\n<p>Queste capacità, un tempo esclusivo appannaggio delle agenzie d&#8217;intelligence statali, sono ora disponibili commercialmente, ridefinendo i paradigmi della cybersecurity spaziale e della sicurezza nazionale. Come evidenziato dal National Reconnaissance Office nelle sue strategie per lo spazio commerciale, questa democratizzazione dell&#8217;intelligence spaziale richiede nuovi framework per la protezione delle infrastrutture orbitali commerciali.</p>\n<h2>Interrogativi legali irrisolti nella cybersecurity spaziale moderna</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;<a href=\"https://www.espi.or.at/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ESPI-Public-Report-72-Europe-Space-and-Defence-Full-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European Space Policy Institute (ESPI)</a>, nel suo rapporto del 2023 intitolato &#8220;Space, Cyber and Defence: Navigating interdisciplinary challenges&#8221;, ha posto domande fondamentali che la comunità internazionale della cybersecurity spaziale deve ancora affrontare compiutamente:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cosa costituisce un attacco contro un sistema spaziale? Il jamming radiofrequenza è un attacco? Lo spoofing GPS? Un attacco cyber che non causa danni fisici permanenti ma disabilita temporaneamente un satellite?</li>\n<li>Come si stabilisce se un satellite è civile, militare o dual-use? La distinzione è fondamentale per applicare il diritto internazionale umanitario, ma nella pratica risulta sempre più sfumata.</li>\n<li>Quali sono le responsabilità legali di un&#8217;azienda privata che fornisce servizi a forze militari? Un attacco a un satellite commerciale che serve scopi militari può essere considerato legittimo secondo il diritto internazionale dei conflitti armati?</li>\n<li>Chi è responsabile dei danni collaterali quando un attacco cyber a un satellite causa interruzioni di servizi civili in paesi terzi neutrali?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Queste domande non sono meramente accademiche. La loro risposta determinerà se la cybersecurity spaziale potrà essere governata attraverso norme internazionali condivise, o se lo spazio diventerà far west digitale dove prevale la legge del più forte. La mancanza di risposte chiare crea zone grigie che attori ostili possono sfruttare, conducendo operazioni aggressive contro infrastrutture spaziali rimanendo al di sotto della soglia che costituirebbe formalmente atto di guerra.</p>\n<h2>Operazioni nella zona grigia: il dilemma strategico della cybersecurity spaziale</h2>\n<p>Le operazioni nella zona grigia rappresentano una delle sfide più insidiose per la cybersecurity spaziale moderna. Come evidenziato dall&#8217;<a href=\"https://www.espi.or.at/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ESPI-Public-Report-72-Europe-Space-and-Defence-Full-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European Space Policy Institute</a>, diversi Stati conducono attualmente attività spaziali che si collocano in una zona grigia strategica, né pace né guerra, sfruttando deliberatamente l&#8217;ambiguità del diritto internazionale dello spazio. Questa dimensione operativa sotto soglia permette agli attori ostili di condurre azioni aggressive contro infrastrutture satellitari senza attraversare formalmente la linea che costituirebbe un atto di guerra secondo il diritto internazionale.</p>\n<p>Le operazioni cyber contro satelliti incarnano perfettamente questa strategia della zona grigia: un attacco DDoS che degrada temporaneamente un servizio satellitare, lo jamming elettronico che interferisce con le comunicazioni, lo spoofing GPS che falsifica coordinate di navigazione, o l&#8217;intrusione cyber che compromette sistemi di controllo senza causare danni fisici permanenti. Queste azioni producono effetti strategici significativi ma rimangono intenzionalmente al di sotto della soglia che attiverebbe meccanismi di difesa collettiva come l&#8217;Articolo 5 della NATO o l&#8217;Articolo 42.7 del Trattato di Lisbona. L&#8217;assenza di un quadro normativo chiaro crea zone grigie che gli attori ostili possono sfruttare, conducendo operazioni aggressive contro infrastrutture spaziali mentre rimangono al di sotto della soglia che costituirebbe formalmente un atto di guerra.</p>\n<p>Questa ambiguità strategica crea vantaggi asimmetrici per gli aggressori: possono testare le difese avversarie, raccogliere intelligence sulle vulnerabilità dei sistemi satellitari, compromettere progressivamente le capacità spaziali nemiche e mantenere la negabilità plausibile delle proprie azioni, tutto mentre evitano ritorsioni formali. Per le democrazie occidentali, questa situazione pone dilemmi acuti di risposta: come reagire a interferenze che causano danni operativi significativi ma non configurano tecnicamente un attacco armato? Come attribuire responsabilità quando gli attaccanti operano attraverso proxy o tecniche di obfuscation? Come calibrare una risposta proporzionata senza rischiare escalation in conflitto aperto?</p>\n<p>La mancanza di consenso internazionale su cosa costituisca una &#8220;minaccia&#8221; nello spazio o un &#8220;uso della forza&#8221; contro asset orbitali perpetua questa pericolosa ambiguità. Fino a quando la comunità internazionale non svilupperà norme condivise e verificabili per distinguere attività legittime da azioni ostili nella cybersecurity spaziale, la zona grigia continuerà ad espandersi, erodendo la stabilità strategica e incentivando comportamenti sempre più aggressivi mascherati da attività sotto soglia. La definizione di confini chiari e l&#8217;elaborazione di meccanismi di attribuzione affidabili rappresentano priorità urgenti per prevenire che la zona grigia spaziale divenga il terreno prediletto per il prossimo confronto tra potenze globali.</p>\n<h2>Dominio cyber-spaziale: convergenza e vulnerabilità delle infrastrutture orbitali</h2>\n<p>La cybersecurity spaziale opera all&#8217;intersezione tra due domini strategici che condividono caratteristiche fondamentali: lo spazio extra-atmosferico e il cyberspazio. Entrambi sono privi di confini fisici definiti, caratteristica che contrasta radicalmente con la concezione tradizionale di sicurezza basata sulla protezione dei confini nazionali. Questa assenza di limiti geografici rende la protezione dei satelliti intrinsecamente più complessa rispetto alla difesa di asset terrestri.</p>\n<p>Il dominio spaziale comprende satelliti in orbita bassa terrestre (LEO, tra 160 e 2.000 km), orbita media (MEO, tra 2.000 e 35.786 km) e orbita geostazionaria (GEO, a 35.786 km), insieme alle relative infrastrutture a monte (upstream: produzione, lancio, controllo) e a valle (downstream: servizi e applicazioni). Il cyberspazio, dominio immateriale delle reti digitali e delle informazioni, attraversa trasversalmente tutti gli altri domini – terrestre, marittimo, aereo, spaziale – rappresentando potenziale minaccia che si propaga senza rispettare confini fisici.</p>\n<p>La convergenza tra questi domini crea interdipendenze profonde che amplificano le sfide della cybersecurity spaziale: le comunicazioni satellitari dipendono da protocolli cyber, la geolocalizzazione GPS guida sistemi informatici terrestri, l&#8217;osservazione terrestre genera enormi flussi di dati che attraversano reti digitali, l&#8217;Internet delle Cose (IoT) si appoggia a connettività satellitare per aree remote, i servizi finanziari utilizzano i timestamp ultra-precisi forniti dai satelliti GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) per sincronizzare transazioni globali.</p>\n<p>La sicurezza complessiva di questo ecosistema dipende dal livello di protezione di ciascun anello della catena, rendendo la cybersecurity spaziale cruciale per la resilienza dell&#8217;intera società digitale. Come evidenziato nei rapporti dell&#8217;Agenzia Spaziale Europea (ESA), una compromissione delle infrastrutture spaziali può propagarsi rapidamente attraverso sistemi terrestri interconnessi, causando effetti a cascata su scala globale.</p>\n<h2>Democratizzazione dello spazio e moltiplicazione delle minacce</h2>\n<p>La democratizzazione dell&#8217;accesso allo spazio ha trasformato radicalmente il panorama della cybersecurity spaziale. Il <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200001093\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">costo per lanciare un chilogrammo di payload in orbita</a> è sceso vertiginosamente: da circa 55.000 dollari dello Space Shuttle negli anni Ottanta ai circa 2.700 dollari del Falcon 9 di SpaceX nel 2024. Questa riduzione di oltre il 95% ha moltiplicato esponenzialmente il numero di attori con capacità spaziali.</p>\n<p>Dalle superpotenze tradizionali a nazioni emergenti, da grandi corporazioni a startup innovative, persino università e consorzi di ricerca possono ora lanciare satelliti. Per la cybersecurity spaziale, questo significa una superficie di attacco enormemente espansa: ogni nuovo satellite rappresenta un potenziale obiettivo, ogni nuovo operatore introduce variabilità negli standard di sicurezza satellitare, ogni nuova costellazione crea complessità addizionale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spacefoundation.org/2023/07/25/the-space-report-2023-q2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">L&#8217;economia spaziale globale ha raggiunto nel 2022</a> il valore di 546 miliardi di dollari secondo il rapporto della Space Foundation pubblicato a luglio 2023, con il segmento commerciale che rappresenta il 78% del totale. Questo dato sottolinea un cambiamento fondamentale: lo spazio non è più dominio esclusivo delle agenzie governative come NASA o ESA, ma mercato dinamico dove operano migliaia di aziende private con obiettivi primariamente commerciali.</p>\n<p>Per la cybersecurity spaziale, questa transizione solleva interrogativi cruciali: come garantire standard di sicurezza omogenei quando gli operatori rispondono a logiche di mercato piuttosto che a imperativi di sicurezza nazionale? Come bilanciare l&#8217;innovazione rapida richiesta dalla competizione commerciale con i tempi lunghi necessari per certificare sistemi satellitari sicuri?</p>\n<h2>Mega-costellazioni: sfida esponenziale per la sicurezza orbitale</h2>\n<p>Le mega-costellazioni incarnano questa nuova realtà e rappresentano sfida senza precedenti per la cybersecurity spaziale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://starlink.com/updates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink di SpaceX conta oltre 6.750 satelliti operativi</a> (dato febbraio 2025) con piani per raggiungere 12.000, trasformando la sicurezza delle costellazioni satellitari in problema di scala industriale</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Kuiper\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Project Kuiper prevede di lanciare 3.236 satelliti entro il 2029</a>, richiedendo framework di sicurezza completamente nuovi</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/oneweb\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OneWeb ha dispiegato 648 satelliti</a> per connettività globale, ciascuno richiedente protezione cyber individuale</li>\n<li>Planet Labs gestisce oltre 200 satelliti di osservazione terrestre ad alta risoluzione, generando petabyte di dati che richiedono crittografia e protezione da alterazioni</li>\n<li>Capella Space opera costellazione di satelliti SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) capaci di imaging in ogni condizione meteorologica</li>\n</ul>\n<p>L&#8217;Unione Europea sta sviluppando IRIS², un&#8217;infrastruttura di 290 satelliti per comunicazioni governative sicure e connettività europea sovrana, con requisiti stringenti di cybersecurity spaziale integrata fin dalla progettazione.</p>\n<p>Questa proliferazione presenta sfide inedite per la protezione dei sistemi satellitari. Gestire la sicurezza di migliaia di satelliti interconnessi richiede automazione avanzata, intelligenza artificiale per il rilevamento di anomalie, protocolli standardizzati per la condivisione di informazioni sulle minacce. Le costellazioni creano inoltre nuovi vettori di attacco: i collegamenti inter-satellitari (inter-satellite links) permettono comunicazioni ottiche o radio tra satelliti senza transitare da stazioni terrestri, aumentando la resilienza ma anche creando percorsi che un attaccante potrebbe sfruttare per propagare compromissioni attraverso l&#8217;intera costellazione.</p>\n<p>Come evidenziato dal Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) nei suoi standard tecnici di sicurezza, la sicurezza delle mega-costellazioni richiede approcci completamente nuovi rispetto ai satelliti singoli tradizionali, con focus su resilienza distribuita e isolamento automatico di nodi compromessi.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Una delle espressioni che è balzata alle cronache recentemente è “crypto scams 2025”, simbolo di un fenomeno in crescita che ha bruciato miliardi di dollari tra truffe, hack e frodi d’investimento. L’articolo analizza come la tecnologia blockchain, nata per garantire trasparenza e decentralizzazione, stia diventando anche l’arma principale per smascherare la criminalità digitale, con l’Italia tra i protagonisti nella ricerca e nelle investigazioni forensi.</p>\n<p>Nel 2024, gli americani hanno perso 16.6 miliardi di dollari a causa della criminalità informatica, di cui 9.3 miliardi direttamente legati alle criptovalute. Un paradosso singolare: le stesse tecnologie blockchain progettate per garantire privacy e decentralizzazione stanno diventando gli strumenti più potenti nelle mani degli investigatori digitali. La <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUxcsGbjKtM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Laura Ricci</a> dell&#8217;Università di Pisa lo spiega con efficacia: &#8220;La blockchain non è solo il registro delle transazioni Bitcoin, ma un vero e proprio notaio digitale che rende tracciabile ciò che i criminali credevano invisibile.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Questa contraddizione apparente nasconde una verità più complessa. Mentre le truffe crypto continuano a crescere del 66% anno su anno secondo l&#8217;FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center, le forze dell&#8217;ordine stanno affinando tecniche investigative che sfruttano proprio l&#8217;immutabilità e la trasparenza delle blockchain pubbliche. Il risultato? Una corsa agli armamenti tecnologica dove ogni nuovo strumento di anonimizzazione trova la sua contromisura forense.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;anatomia tecnica dell&#8217;investigazione blockchain: oltre il mito dell&#8217;anonimato</h2>\n<p>Quando Ross Ulbricht lanciò Silk Road nel 2011, credeva che l&#8217;anonimato di Tor combinato con i pagamenti in Bitcoin avrebbe creato un mercato nero invulnerabile. Non aveva fatto i conti con una realtà fondamentale: Bitcoin non offre anonimato, ma pseudo-anonimato. La differenza è abissale.</p>\n<p>Ogni transazione Bitcoin lascia tracce indelebili sulla blockchain. Gli investigatori forensi utilizzano tecniche sofisticate di <strong>address clustering</strong> per collegare indirizzi apparentemente scollegati alla stessa entità. L&#8217;euristica più potente è la common input heuristic: quando più indirizzi Bitcoin vengono utilizzati come input nella stessa transazione, con alta probabilità appartengono allo stesso wallet o utente. Chainalysis, leader globale nell&#8217;analisi blockchain con oltre 100 euristiche proprietarie che monitorano 25+ blockchain, ha costruito il suo impero su questo principio.</p>\n<p>Ma c&#8217;è di più. La <strong>change address detection</strong> permette di distinguere quali output di una transazione rappresentano il pagamento reale e quali sono il &#8220;resto&#8221; che torna al mittente. Tecniche di <strong>graph analysis</strong> trasformano la blockchain in una rete sociale dove algoritmi come PageRank identificano nodi centrali nelle reti criminali. La <strong>taint analysis</strong> traccia la &#8220;contaminazione&#8221; dei fondi attraverso catene di transazioni, quantificando matematicamente quanto denaro pulito si mescola con fondi illeciti.</p>\n<p>Il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory, guidato dalla Prof. Ricci con 3 membri permanenti, 2 post-doc e 6 dottorandi, ha contribuito significativamente a questa scienza emergente. Le loro ricerche sulla struttura &#8220;bow tie&#8221; del grafo degli utenti Bitcoin hanno rivelato pattern comportamentali che distinguono attività legittime da schemi di riciclaggio. Quando i Carabinieri italiani, attraverso il Maggiore Simone Vecchiarello della Sezione Criptovalute del Comando Antifalsificazione Monetaria, applicano questi algoritmi sul campo, i risultati sono tangibili: operazioni che portano al sequestro di milioni in asset digitali.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;epidemia delle investment fraud: 6.57 miliardi evaporati nel 2024 – il volto delle crypto scams 2025</h2>\n<p>Se dovessimo identificare il volto dominante della criminalità crypto nel 2024, sarebbe quello delle investment fraud. Con 6.57 miliardi di dollari persi secondo l&#8217;FBI IC3 Report, rappresentano il 40% di tutte le perdite legate a criptovalute. Non stiamo parlando di hack tecnici o exploit di smart contract, ma di ingegneria sociale applicata con precisione chirurgica.</p>\n<p>Le truffe &#8220;pig butchering&#8221; meritano attenzione particolare per la loro sofisticazione psicologica. Il termine, traduzione letterale del cinese &#8220;sha zhu pan&#8221; (letteralmente &#8220;piatto di maiale macellato&#8221;), descrive una truffa in più fasi dove la vittima viene &#8220;ingrassata&#8221; con piccoli guadagni iniziali prima della &#8220;macellazione&#8221; finale. Il truffatore costruisce una relazione online, spesso romantica, che può durare settimane o mesi. Introduce gradualmente opportunità di investimento in criptovalute, mostrandosi esperto e condividendo screenshot di profitti apparentemente reali. Quando la vittima investe somme significative, i fondi spariscono e con loro il truffatore.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;impatto demografico è devastante. Le vittime over-60 hanno perso 4.885 miliardi di dollari nel 2024, rappresentando il 52% delle perdite totali da investment fraud. Questi numeri raccontano una storia di vulnerabilità generazionale: una popolazione cresciuta nell&#8217;era pre-digitale si confronta con truffe progettate da nativi digitali che sfruttano sofisticati bias cognitivi.</p>\n<h2>Hack da record: quando 1.5 miliardi evaporano in una notte</h2>\n<p>Febbraio 2025 ha segnato un punto di svolta nella storia della criminalità crypto. ByBit, uno dei maggiori exchange al mondo, ha subito il furto più grande della storia: 1.5 miliardi di dollari spariti in quella che l&#8217;FBI ha formalmente attribuito alla Corea del Nord attraverso una Public Service Announcement pubblicata il 26 febbraio 2025.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;attacco dimostra l&#8217;evoluzione delle capacità offensive degli stati-nazione nel dominio crypto. Il gruppo Lazarus, braccio cyber del regime nordcoreano, ha mostrato una padronanza tecnica che combina social engineering avanzato, infiltrazione delle infrastrutture IT e conoscenza profonda dei protocolli blockchain. Secondo Chainalysis, al 31 luglio 2025 i furti totali hanno raggiunto 2.17 miliardi di dollari, con gli exchange che assorbono il 76.65% delle perdite.</p>\n<p>Ma c&#8217;è un dettaglio che sfugge alle statistiche aggregate: il 23.35% dei furti ha colpito wallet personali, con 8.5 miliardi di dollari in crypto rubate ancora detenute on-chain. Questi &#8220;wrench attacks&#8221; rappresentano un&#8217;evoluzione inquietante del crimine crypto. Non servono più exploit zero-day o vulnerabilità dei smart contract: basta violenza fisica o minacce credibili per ottenere seed phrase e chiavi private. È il ritorno a forme di criminalità brutalmente tradizionali applicate a tecnologie ultramoderne.</p>\n<h2>Ransomware: il declino inaspettato che spiega più di quanto sembri</h2>\n<p>Se c&#8217;è una statistica che sorprende nell&#8217;anno della crescita esponenziale delle truffe crypto, è questa: i pagamenti ransomware sono crollati del 35.82% nel 2024, scendendo a 813.55 milioni di dollari dai 1.25 miliardi dell&#8217;anno precedente. Chainalysis attribuisce questo declino a tre fattori convergenti: maggiore resilienza delle vittime che rifiutano di pagare, operazioni di law enforcement più efficaci contro le gang ransomware, e migliore cyber hygiene aziendale.</p>\n<p>Ma questo apparente successo nasconde una realtà più complessa. Il numero di attacchi ransomware non è diminuito significativamente; è diminuito il tasso di successo dei pagamenti. Le aziende stanno imparando che pagare non garantisce il recupero dei dati e finanzia ulteriori attacchi. Le banche dati di backup offline stanno diventando standard, rendendo meno critico il pagamento del riscatto.</p>\n<p>Contemporaneamente, le frodi ai crypto ATM sono esplose del 99% in termini di complaint (anche se le perdite monetarie sono aumentate del 31%), raggiungendo 246.7 milioni di dollari secondo l&#8217;FBI. Questo spostamento rivela un pattern: quando una modalità di attacco diventa meno profittevole, i criminali migrano rapidamente verso vettori alternativi. I crypto ATM offrono vantaggio cruciale: anonimato operativo e conversione immediata cash-to-crypto senza KYC rigoroso.</p>\n<h2>Silk Road, FTX e Bitfinex: lezioni magistrali di analisi forense</h2>\n<p>Alcuni casi studio trascendono la cronaca criminale per diventare manuali operativi dell&#8217;investigazione blockchain. Silk Road rimane l&#8217;archetipo: quando l&#8217;FBI arrestò Ross Ulbricht nell&#8217;ottobre 2013, sequestrando oltre 600,000 Bitcoin (successivamente convertiti in oltre un miliardo di dollari), l&#8217;operazione combinò <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/osint-caos-digitale/\">OSINT</a> tradizionale e analisi blockchain pionieristica.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;errore fatale di Ulbricht? Un post su un forum nel 2011 dove l&#8217;username &#8220;altoid&#8221; aveva promosso Silk Road indicando l&#8217;email &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:rossulbricht@gmail.com\">rossulbricht@gmail.com</a>&#8221; per ulteriori informazioni. L&#8217;analisi forense blockchain fece il resto: tracciare commissioni attraverso migliaia di transazioni, identificare pattern di consolidamento nei wallet, correlare temporalmente depositi e prelievi. La lezione è chiara: l&#8217;anonimato è una catena, forte quanto il suo anello più debole.</p>\n<p>FTX rappresenta il polo opposto dello spettro criminale. Non un mercato nero costruito sull&#8217;anonimato, ma una frode finanziaria da 8 miliardi di dollari perpetrata in piena luce, con l&#8217;apparenza di legittimità. Nansen Analytics ha tracciato 280 milioni di token FTT (80% del supply totale) controllati da entità FTX/Alameda, rivelando la manipolazione sistemica che sosteneva l&#8217;impero di Sam Bankman-Fried. Quando FTX è collassato, 477 milioni di dollari sono stati rubati in circostanze ancora poco chiare, con 74 milioni riciclati ironicamente attraverso RenBridge, un servizio controllato dalla stessa Alameda Research.</p>\n<p>Ma è il caso Bitfinex che dimostra la pazienza metodica dell&#8217;analisi forense blockchain. Nel 2016, hacker sconosciuti rubarono 119,754 Bitcoin dall&#8217;exchange (circa 72 milioni di dollari all&#8217;epoca). Per cinque anni, gli investigatori hanno tracciato meticolosamente ogni movimento di questi fondi attraverso exchange, mixer e wallet. Nel febbraio 2022, l&#8217;FBI ha arrestato Ilya Lichtenstein e Heather Morgan, sequestrando 94,000 Bitcoin valutati 3.6 miliardi di dollari al momento del sequestro (oltre 10 miliardi ai prezzi attuali).</p>\n<p>La tecnica chiave? Peeling chain analysis: seguire la &#8220;spellatura&#8221; sistematica di un grande wallet in porzioni sempre più piccole attraverso migliaia di transazioni. Ma il breakthrough decisivo venne da errori operativi offline: acquisti con gift card Walmart pagati in Bitcoin tracciabili a conti personali. Ancora una volta, la lezione è che la blockchain forense funziona meglio quando combinata con investigazione tradizionale.</p>\n<h2>Italia in prima linea: ecosistema di eccellenza tra ricerca e law enforcement</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;Italia sta costruendo un ecosistema crypto forensics tra i più avanzati d&#8217;Europa, combinando ricerca accademica d&#8217;avanguardia, forze dell&#8217;ordine altamente specializzate e framework normativi progressivi. Questa sinergia multi-attore rappresenta un modello di riferimento internazionale.</p>\n<p>Il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory guida la ricerca accademica italiana. La Prof. Laura Ricci, coordinatrice del curriculum &#8220;Sistemi sociali e società smart&#8221; nel Dottorato Nazionale in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies ed ex membro del gruppo di esperti del Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico per la strategia nazionale blockchain (2018-2019), ha creato un laboratorio con 3 membri permanenti, 2 post-doc, 2 ricercatori CNR e 6 dottorandi. Le pubblicazioni su graph analysis, detection di comportamenti artificiali e clustering di indirizzi Bitcoin non restano confinate alle riviste peer-reviewed: diventano algoritmi operativi per le forze dell&#8217;ordine.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Osservatorio Blockchain &amp; Web3 del Politecnico di Milano, nato nel 2018, rappresenta il polo di riferimento nazionale per l&#8217;analisi del mercato blockchain. Con la collaborazione tra il Dipartimento di Ingegneria Gestionale e il Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, l&#8217;Osservatorio monitora 2,033 progetti globali dal 2016, quantificando il mercato italiano blockchain a 42 milioni di euro con crescita del 50% annuale. Il Blockchain Innovation &amp; Solutions HUB facilita ricerca applicata pre-competitiva tra aziende, università e istituzioni.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Università di Perugia ospita il Cybersecurity Lab diretto dal Prof. Stefano Bistarelli, vincitore del Microsoft Azure Research Award per il progetto &#8220;Data Science for investigating the block-chain in Bitcoin&#8221;. Il laboratorio sviluppa tecniche per identificare indirizzi blockchain utilizzati per attività illecite, contribuendo alla formazione di &#8220;hacker etici&#8221; attraverso CyberChallenge.IT.</p>\n<p>Sul fronte operativo, i Carabinieri hanno istituito strutture specializzate uniche in Europa. Il Maggiore Simone Vecchiarello guida la Sezione Criptovalute del Comando Carabinieri Antifalsificazione Monetaria, sviluppando script proprietari per la ricostruzione di seed phrase e tecniche avanzate di analisi on-chain che combinano Chainalysis Reactor con tool interni. L&#8217;operazione Franco Lee ha dimostrato queste capacità: smantellamento di una rete da 8.8 milioni di euro con sequestro di Bitcoin, USDT, Ethereum e Matic.</p>\n<p>La Guardia di Finanza opera attraverso due nuclei specialistici d&#8217;eccellenza. Il Nucleo Speciale Tutela Privacy e Frodi Tecnologiche, con 5 gruppi investigativi dedicati, monitora costantemente Clear Web, Dark Web e Deep Web per individuare riciclaggio e finanziamento del terrorismo. Utilizza software avanzati di blockchain analysis per tracciare wallet anonimi e transazioni sospette. Il Nucleo Speciale Polizia Valutaria si concentra sul contrasto ai flussi finanziari illeciti, collaborando strettamente con il Nucleo Privacy per operazioni congiunte.</p>\n<p>Le operazioni recenti testimoniano l&#8217;efficacia di questa specializzazione: sequestro di 11 milioni di euro in Bitcoin e Avalanche per evasione fiscale (prima operazione europea di questa portata), individuazione di un trader con cripto-attività per 270 milioni di euro, e sequestro di wallet da 9 milioni di dollari creato con documenti falsi e deepfake. La Guardia di Finanza ha redatto una &#8220;Guida Operativa sulle investigazioni tecnologiche&#8221; distribuita a tutti i reparti, e partecipa a master universitari presso le Università &#8220;Tor Vergata&#8221; e &#8220;La Sapienza&#8221; di Roma, creando un circolo virtuoso tra formazione e operatività.</p>\n<p>La Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni ha gestito 54,554 fascicoli nel 2024, con truffe online che hanno sottratto 181 milioni di euro (+32% rispetto al 2023). Questi numeri raccontano pressione criminale crescente ma anche capacità investigativa in evoluzione, con cooperazione internazionale continua attraverso Europol, Interpol ed EPPO.</p>\n<p>Il framework normativo completa l&#8217;ecosistema. L&#8217;implementazione del regolamento MiCAR attraverso il Decreto Legislativo 129/2024 ha creato supervisione condivisa tra Banca d&#8217;Italia e CONSOB, posizionando l&#8217;Italia tra i primi paesi europei con compliance piena alle direttive comunitarie. Questa rapidità normativa, combinata con eccellenza accademica e specializzazione operativa, trasforma l&#8217;Italia in un laboratorio dove innovazione tecnologica e legalità non sono antagonisti ma alleati strategici nella guerra globale contro la criminalità finanziaria digitale.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;arsenale tecnologico: quando l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale incontra la blockchain</h2>\n<p>L&#8217;analisi forense blockchain del 2025 è irriconoscibile rispetto a quella di cinque anni fa. Le piattaforme professionali come Chainalysis Reactor non si limitano più a tracciare transazioni: utilizzano machine learning per predire comportamenti, identificare pattern anomali in tempo reale, e assegnare risk scores automatizzati a indirizzi e transazioni.</p>\n<p>Elliptic, con il suo database di 6.4 miliardi di indirizzi etichettati su 43 reti blockchain, applica Graph Neural Networks (GNN) per migliorare l&#8217;accuratezza del clustering del 10-15% rispetto ai metodi tradizionali. Ma è nell&#8217;applicazione di algoritmi di ransomware detection che il machine learning mostra risultati impressionanti: modelli basati su Random Forest e XGBoost raggiungono F1-score tra 0.85 e 0.95, con picchi di accuratezza del 99.5% su dataset di transazioni Bitcoin correlate a ransomware.</p>\n<p>La ricerca accademica sta esplorando frontiere ancora più avanzate. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) analizzano reti di transazioni con accuratezza superiore del 15% rispetto ai metodi classici, identificando anomalie comportamentali che sfuggono all&#8217;occhio umano e agli algoritmi tradizionali. Natural Language Processing applicato al monitoraggio del dark web correla menzioni di indirizzi crypto con coordinamento criminale, creando intelligence actionable in tempo reale.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, questa potenza computazionale solleva questioni etiche profonde. Quando sistemi di intelligenza artificiale possono tracciare ogni movimento finanziario di un individuo attraverso la blockchain, dove tracciamo il confine tra sicurezza e sorveglianza di massa? Il GDPR europeo introduce tensioni fondamentali: come garantire il &#8220;diritto all&#8217;oblio&#8221; su una tecnologia progettata per essere immutabile?</p>\n<h2>Privacy versus sicurezza: il dilemma irrisolto delle privacy coin</h2>\n<p>Monero rappresenta la risposta tecnologica più sofisticata al problema della privacy blockchain. Con ring signatures, stealth addresses e RingCT che oscurano mittente, destinatario e ammontare di ogni transazione, Monero rimane largamente intracciabile nonostante l&#8217;IRS abbia offerto 1.25 milioni di dollari in contratti (625,000 dollari ciascuno a Chainalysis e Integra FEC) per sviluppare strumenti di tracciamento.</p>\n<p>Il fallimento di questi sforzi non è tecnologico ma fondamentale: Monero è progettato con privacy-by-default a livello protocollare, non come funzione aggiuntiva. Zcash offre privacy attraverso zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), ma la sua scelta di rendere le transazioni schermate opzionali lo rende vulnerabile: meno dell&#8217;1% delle transazioni sono fully shielded, creando un &#8220;anonymity set&#8221; troppo piccolo per garantire vera privacy.</p>\n<p>Questo solleva domande scomode. Se tecnologie come Monero rendono impossibile il tracciamento, dovrebbero essere bandite? O il diritto alla privacy finanziaria è fondamentale in una società libera? Non esistono risposte semplici. I difensori della privacy citano diritti costituzionali e la necessità di proteggere dissidenti politici, whistleblower e cittadini in regimi autoritari. Gli investigatori sottolineano che la stessa tecnologia facilita terrorismo, traffico di esseri umani e pedopornografia.</p>\n<p>Il futuro potrebbe risiedere in approcci intermedi. Zero-knowledge proofs permettono di provare proprietà di dati senza rivelare i dati stessi. È teoricamente possibile costruire sistemi dove un&#8217;autorità giudiziaria possa ottenere informazioni su transazioni specifiche attraverso meccanismi di &#8220;privacy selettiva&#8221;, mantenendo anonimato per tutti gli altri. Ma implementare questi sistemi senza backdoor sfruttabili da attori malintenzionati rimane una sfida ingegneristica aperta.</p>\n<h2>La minaccia quantistica: quando la crittografia diventa obsoleta</h2>\n<p>Esiste una minaccia esistenziale che aleggia su tutta la crittografia moderna: il quantum computing. Gli algoritmi di Shor, eseguiti su computer quantistici sufficientemente potenti, potrebbero rompere gli schemi di firma digitale ECDSA che proteggono Bitcoin ed Ethereum. Il consenso accademico e degli esperti NIST colloca questa minaccia in un orizzonte temporale di 10-15 anni.</p>\n<p>Il problema non è ipotetico. Ogni transazione Bitcoin espone temporaneamente la chiave pubblica, che un quantum computer potrebbe teoricamente usare per derivare la chiave privata. Fondi in indirizzi &#8220;pay-to-public-key&#8221; non ancora spesi sono particolarmente vulnerabili. Si stima che tra 2 e 5 milioni di Bitcoin (valore attuale superiore a 200 miliardi di dollari) siano in indirizzi vulnerabili, molti appartenenti agli early adopter incluso Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>\n<p>La comunità cripto è consapevole del rischio. Sono in sviluppo algoritmi di firma post-quantum come Lattice-based cryptography e Hash-based signatures. Ma la migrazione richiederà un hard fork coordinato delle principali blockchain, un processo politicamente complesso e tecnicamente rischioso. La finestra temporale è stretta: dobbiamo implementare crittografia post-quantum prima che computer quantistici sufficientemente potenti diventino disponibili, ma evitare migrazioni premature verso algoritmi non sufficientemente testati.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive future: tra regolamentazione e innovazione tecnologica</h2>\n<p>Il 2025 segna un punto di inflessione nella guerra contro la criminalità crypto. La regolamentazione MiCAR in Europa, l&#8217;implementazione italiana attraverso il Decreto Legislativo 129/2024 con supervisione di Banca d&#8217;Italia e CONSOB, e gli sforzi di armonizzazione normativa globale stanno creando un framework dove innovazione tecnologica e compliance non sono antagonisti.</p>\n<p>Le sfide rimangono monumentali. Le forze dell&#8217;ordine devono processare oltre 100 milioni di transazioni giornaliere attraverso blockchain multiple, identificando in tempo reale quelle sospette. La scarsità di dati di addestramento etichettati limita l&#8217;efficacia dei modelli di machine learning. Le tecniche criminali evolvono più rapidamente degli aggiornamenti dei modelli investigativi.</p>\n<p>Ma emerge anche motivo di cauto ottimismo. La collaborazione tra accademia, industria e law enforcement sta dando frutti concreti. Centri di eccellenza come il Pisa Distributed Ledger Laboratory, l&#8217;Osservatorio Blockchain &amp; Web3 del Politecnico di Milano, e il Cybersecurity Lab dell&#8217;Università di Perugia dimostrano che la ricerca può tradursi rapidamente in capacità operative. L&#8217;Italia, con la sua combinazione di eccellenza accademica e forze dell&#8217;ordine sempre più specializzate, si posiziona all&#8217;avanguardia di questa battaglia.</p>\n<p>Il futuro della sicurezza blockchain dipenderà dalla nostra capacità di bilanciare tre imperativi apparentemente in conflitto: preservare l&#8217;innovazione tecnologica che rende le criptovalute rivoluzionarie, proteggere i diritti di privacy dei cittadini onesti, e fornire alle forze dell&#8217;ordine strumenti efficaci per combattere criminalità che non conosce confini. Non è un equilibrio facile da trovare, ma è l&#8217;unico percorso sostenibile per un futuro dove finanza decentralizzata e sicurezza possano coesistere.</p>\n<p>La battaglia contro i crypto scams non è solo tecnologica, ma profondamente umana: richiede vigilanza, educazione, cooperazione internazionale e la volontà di adattare continuamente strumenti e strategie a un panorama criminale in costante evoluzione. I 16.6 miliardi di dollari persi nel 2024 non sono solo statistiche, ma vite devastate, risparmi evaporati, fiducia tradita. Ogni caso risolto, ogni milione recuperato, ogni rete criminale smantellata rappresenta non solo una vittoria investigativa, ma un passo verso un ecosistema crypto più sicuro, più trasparente e più degno della fiducia che milioni di persone vi ripongono.</p>\n<h2>Fonti:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-annual-internet-crime-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Bureau of Investigation.

      "content": "<p>Quando si parla di acquisizione transfrontaliera di <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/pubblicazioni/digital-forensics-nel-processo-penale/\">prove digitali nei procedimenti penali</a>, ci troviamo di fronte a una delle sfide più complesse che il diritto processuale penale europeo abbia mai affrontato. Non si tratta semplicemente di armonizzare procedure: stiamo ridisegnando il rapporto tra sovranità nazionale, tutela dei diritti fondamentali e necessità investigative in un ecosistema digitale dove i dati non rispettano confini geografici e i <em>provider</em> di servizi possono trovarsi a migliaia di chilometri dalla giurisdizione richiedente.</p>\n<p>Gli schemi di decreto legislativo attualmente all&#8217;esame delle Commissioni parlamentari italiane – <a href=\"https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:1999-07-30;303~art3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">l&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 303</a> e <a href=\"https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-02-01&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0023\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">l&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 330</a> – rappresentano il tentativo italiano di dare attuazione a questo nuovo paradigma normativo. Ma al di là della mera trasposizione tecnica delle norme europee, questi provvedimenti sollevano questioni che toccano il cuore stesso della <em>digital forensics</em>, della cooperazione investigativa e della tutela dei diritti nella società dell&#8217;informazione.</p>\n<h2>Dal sistema tradizionale alla rivoluzione E-Evidence: un cambio di paradigma</h2>\n<p>Per comprendere appieno la portata innovativa del <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/it/policies/e-evidence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pacchetto E-Evidence</a>, è necessario inquadrarlo nel più ampio sistema di cooperazione internazionale in materia di <em>cybercrime</em>. La <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/il-potenziamento-della-cooperazione-internazionale-in-materia-di-cybercrime-e-prove-elettroniche/\">Convenzione di Budapest</a> del 2001 ha rappresentato per oltre vent&#8217;anni il <a href=\"https://www.ictsecuritymagazine.com/articoli/convenzione-onu-cyber/\">principale strumento di cooperazione</a>, introducendo meccanismi di assistenza giudiziaria reciproca specificamente pensati per i reati informatici.</p>\n<p>Il Secondo Protocollo Addizionale alla Convenzione, adottato dal Comitato dei Ministri del Consiglio d&#8217;Europa il 17 novembre 2021 e aperto alla firma il 12 maggio 2022, ha tentato di modernizzare questi strumenti, introducendo procedure accelerate e contatti diretti tra autorità. Tuttavia, anche questi aggiornamenti non hanno risolto il problema strutturale che affligge l&#8217;investigazione digitale transfrontaliera: i tempi della cooperazione giudiziaria tradizionale, spesso nell&#8217;ordine di mesi, collidono frontalmente con la volatilità delle prove elettroniche, che possono essere cancellate in pochi secondi o automaticamente sovrascritte da <em>retention policies</em> aggressive.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Ordine Europeo di Indagine, introdotto dalla <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0041\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Direttiva 2014/41/UE</a> e recepito in Italia con il decreto legislativo 21 giugno 2017, n. 108, ha semplificato le procedure tra Stati membri dell&#8217;UE sostituendo il sistema delle rogatorie con uno strumento più agile basato sul principio del riconoscimento reciproco. Eppure, anche l&#8217;OEI mantiene il modello della cooperazione «verticale» attraverso le autorità giudiziarie dello Stato di esecuzione, con i conseguenti tempi di tramitazione che, per quanto ridotti rispetto alle rogatorie tradizionali, rimangono incompatibili con l&#8217;urgenza di molte investigazioni digitali.</p>\n<p>Il <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1543\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Regolamento UE 2023/1543</a> e la <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32023L1544\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Direttiva UE 2023/1544</a>, pubblicati nella Gazzetta Ufficiale dell&#8217;Unione Europea il 28 luglio 2023, rappresentano un salto paradigmatico che alcuni studiosi hanno definito «post-westfaliano» perché mette in discussione il principio tradizionale della territorialità della giurisdizione penale. Per la prima volta, viene introdotta la cooperazione «orizzontale», permettendo alle autorità giudiziarie di rivolgersi direttamente ai prestatori di servizi stabiliti in altri Stati membri, bypassando il necessario coinvolgimento preventivo dell&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione. Questa innovazione solleva interrogativi profondi sul bilanciamento tra efficienza investigativa e tutela dei diritti fondamentali, tra necessità di rapidità e garanzie processuali, tra cooperazione europea e sovranità nazionale.</p>\n<h2>L&#8217;architettura del sistema italiano: autorità, procedure e <em>governance</em></h2>\n<p>La decisione del Consiglio dei Ministri dell&#8217;8 ottobre 2025 ha designato il Ministero della Giustizia quale autorità centrale per la gestione del sistema E-Evidence sul territorio nazionale, ma l&#8217;architettura operativa che emerge dalla bozza dell&#8217;Atto del Governo n. 303 è significativamente più complessa e stratificata. Il primo nodo da sciogliere riguarda l&#8217;individuazione delle autorità di emissione competenti, una questione che il regolamento europeo affronta attraverso una graduazione basata sulla tipologia e sull&#8217;invasività dei dati richiesti.</p>\n<h3>La tassonomia dei dati e le implicazioni per le autorità competenti</h3>\n<p>Quando parliamo di prove digitali, la distinzione tra le diverse categorie di dati non è meramente accademica ma ha profonde implicazioni forensi, probatorie e, soprattutto, in termini di tutela dei diritti fondamentali. I dati relativi agli abbonati, quelli che il regolamento definisce come <em>subscriber data</em>, comprendono le informazioni fornite dall&#8217;utente al momento della registrazione del servizio: nome, cognome, <em>alias</em> o <em>username</em>, indirizzo email, numero di telefono, indirizzo postale, data di nascita, informazioni di pagamento come le ultime quattro cifre della carta di credito o l&#8217;IBAN, data di creazione dell&#8217;account e stato dello stesso.</p>\n<p>Questi dati, considerati relativamente poco invasivi perché già condivisi volontariamente dall&#8217;utente con il <em>provider</em>, possono essere richiesti tramite un ordine emesso o convalidato da un pubblico ministero. Il loro valore investigativo risiede principalmente nell&#8217;identificazione del soggetto e nella possibilità di correlare identità digitali multiple che una stessa persona può utilizzare su piattaforme diverse.</p>\n<p>I dati di accesso, o <em>access data</em>, rappresentano un salto qualitativo in termini di invasività. Si tratta delle informazioni tecniche relative alle connessioni: indirizzo IP di connessione, <em>timestamp</em> precisi di <em>login</em> e <em>logout</em>, <em>user agent</em> che rivela il <em>browser</em> e il sistema operativo utilizzato, eventuale geolocalizzazione se disponibile, tipo di dispositivo, identificativi di sessione.</p>\n<p>Questi dati, generati automaticamente dai sistemi al momento dell&#8217;accesso, permettono di ricostruire la <em>timeline</em> di attività dell&#8217;utente, di determinare la sua geolocalizzazione approssimativa attraverso l&#8217;analisi degli indirizzi IP e di identificare i dispositivi specifici utilizzati. Dal punto di vista forense, sono particolarmente preziosi ma anche estremamente volatili, spesso conservati per periodi limitati in base alle <em>data retention policies</em> dei <em>provider</em>. Anche per questi dati, il regolamento consente che l&#8217;autorità di emissione sia il pubblico ministero.</p>\n<p>La situazione si complica quando entriamo nel territorio dei dati relativi alle operazioni, i <em>transactional data</em> che la giurisprudenza della Corte di Giustizia dell&#8217;Unione Europea considera altamente invasivi anche se non includono il contenuto effettivo delle comunicazioni. Nel caso delle email, si tratta degli <em>header</em> completi che rivelano mittente, destinatari in chiaro, in copia e in copia nascosta, l&#8217;oggetto del messaggio, i <em>timestamp</em> precisi e il <em>route</em> seguito dal messaggio attraverso i server. Per le chiamate VoIP, comprendono i numeri del chiamante e del chiamato, la durata della conversazione e i <em>timestamp</em>.</p>\n<p>Per i servizi di messaggistica, si tratta dell&#8217;elenco delle comunicazioni con tutti i metadati ma senza il contenuto dei messaggi. Questi dati permettono di mappare le reti di contatti, di identificare possibili complici, di ricostruire <em>pattern</em> comunicativi che possono essere rivelatori quanto il contenuto stesso delle comunicazioni. La Corte di Giustizia, nelle celebri sentenze <em>Digital Rights Ireland</em> e <em>Tele2 Sverige</em>, ha equiparato l&#8217;accesso massivo a questi dati a una forma di sorveglianza che può rivelare informazioni intime sulla vita privata delle persone. Per questo motivo, il regolamento richiede garanzie più elevate.</p>\n<p>Infine, i <em>content data</em> rappresentano il livello massimo di invasività: il corpo dei messaggi email, il contenuto delle chat, i file allegati, le foto e i video condivisi, i documenti caricati su servizi di <em>cloud storage</em>, i post pubblicati sui <em>social media</em>. Si tratta del contenuto effettivo delle comunicazioni private, che richiede le tutele più stringenti. Per questi dati, il regolamento impone che l&#8217;autorità di emissione sia un giudice, un tribunale o un giudice istruttore, escludendo esplicitamente la competenza del pubblico ministero.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve mappare con precisione chirurgica le autorità nazionali su questo schema europeo, e qui emergono le peculiarità del nostro ordinamento processuale penale. Il pubblico ministero italiano è magistrato inquirente ma non organo giurisdizionale, una distinzione che diventa cruciale soprattutto per i dati relativi alle operazioni e ai contenuti, dove la giurisprudenza europea ha stabilito standard elevati di tutela che richiedono un controllo genuinamente giurisdizionale. Il riferimento naturale per i dati più invasivi sarebbe al giudice per le indagini preliminari, ma il decreto dovrà chiarire se in fase dibattimentale la competenza passi al giudice del dibattimento o rimanga comunque al GIP.</p>\n<h3>Il caso delle emergenze e la questione della polizia giudiziaria</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 7 del regolamento prevede che, in casi di urgenza debitamente accertati, gli ordini europei di produzione possano essere emessi da «qualsiasi altra autorità competente» purché seguiti da convalida giudiziaria entro ventiquattro ore. La formulazione è volutamente ampia per consentire agli Stati membri di adattarla ai propri ordinamenti, ma solleva questioni delicate quando si tratta di attribuire questo potere alla polizia giudiziaria. La legge di delegazione europea 2024 prevede che il Governo coordini le disposizioni nazionali per consentire agli organi di polizia giudiziaria di emettere ordini europei di produzione in casi di emergenza.</p>\n<p>Questa previsione rappresenta un&#8217;innovazione significativa nel nostro sistema processuale, dove la polizia giudiziaria opera tradizionalmente sotto la direzione e il controllo del pubblico ministero ai sensi dell&#8217;articolo 109 della Costituzione e degli articoli 347-348 del codice di procedura penale. Un EPOC emesso autonomamente dalla polizia giudiziaria, anche con successiva convalida, configura uno spazio di autonomia operativa che necessita di essere circoscritto con parametri rigorosi.</p>\n<p>Il decreto dovrà probabilmente limitare questa facoltà a situazioni di reale necessità e urgenza: pericolo imminente di perdita irreparabile delle prove, situazioni di pericolo di vita, indagini su atti di terrorismo o criminalità organizzata transnazionale dove ogni ora può essere decisiva. La convalida giudiziaria entro ventiquattro ore dovrà essere effettiva e non meramente formale, con l&#8217;obbligo per l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria di verificare non solo i presupposti sostanziali dell&#8217;ordine ma anche la sussistenza delle condizioni di urgenza che hanno giustificato l&#8217;emissione da parte della polizia giudiziaria.</p>\n<h3>Il coordinamento con la Direzione Nazionale Antimafia: un tassello cruciale</h3>\n<p>Un aspetto che potrebbe apparire marginale a una lettura superficiale, ma che rivela la sua importanza strategica nell&#8217;ottica del coordinamento investigativo nazionale, è l&#8217;obbligo di trasmettere copia dei certificati EPOC ed EPOC-PR al Procuratore Nazionale Antimafia quando si riferiscono a procedimenti per i delitti indicati all&#8217;articolo 51, comma 3-<em>bis</em> e 3-<em>quater</em> del codice di procedura penale. Si tratta dei delitti di criminalità organizzata, terrorismo, criminalità transnazionale, traffico di stupefacenti, armi ed esseri umani.</p>\n<p>La <em>ratio</em> di questa previsione, inserita nella legge di delegazione, risponde a logiche di coordinamento investigativo fondamentali nel contrasto alla criminalità organizzata: la Direzione Nazionale Antimafia deve avere contezza in tempo reale delle indagini transfrontaliere che potrebbero interconnettersi con altre investigazioni in corso su organizzazioni criminali, permettendo di individuare collegamenti, di evitare sovrapposizioni o conflitti tra procedimenti, di coordinare strategie investigative complesse che coinvolgono più procure.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista tecnico, questo significa che il sistema informatico decentrato dovrà prevedere meccanismi automatizzati di <em>routing</em> delle comunicazioni verso la DNA, con adeguate misure di sicurezza e tracciabilità. La sfida tecnica è garantire che questa trasmissione avvenga in tempo reale o <em>near-real-time</em>, senza creare colli di bottiglia procedurali che rallenterebbero l&#8217;intero meccanismo.</p>\n<h3>Il sistema informatico decentrato: l&#8217;infrastruttura critica invisibile</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 25 del Regolamento 2023/1543 prevede l&#8217;istituzione di un sistema informatico decentrato per la comunicazione sicura e lo scambio di dati tra le autorità competenti e i prestatori di servizi. La terminologia tecnica e burocratica rischia di oscurare la portata di questa infrastruttura: non si tratta di un semplice sistema di messaggistica ma dell&#8217;infrastruttura critica su cui poggia l&#8217;intero meccanismo E-Evidence. Senza un sistema affidabile, sicuro e interoperabile, anche le norme più sofisticate rimangono lettera morta.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;architettura del sistema si basa su un modello decentrato dove ogni Stato membro mantiene il proprio punto di accesso nazionale, interconnesso con gli altri punti di accesso attraverso una rete sicura. Questa scelta architettonica, preferita rispetto a un sistema centralizzato, risponde a multiple esigenze: sovranità nazionale, perché ogni Stato mantiene il controllo sul proprio nodo e sui dati che transitano; resilienza, perché il fallimento di un nodo non compromette l&#8217;intero sistema; scalabilità, perché nuovi Stati membri possono essere aggiunti senza riprogettare l&#8217;architettura complessiva. Il modello ricorda quello adottato per e-CODEX, il sistema utilizzato per lo scambio di informazioni giudiziarie in ambito civile, che ha dimostrato nel corso degli anni una buona tenuta operativa.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve garantire che il punto di accesso nazionale rispetti rigorosi requisiti di sicurezza che vanno ben oltre gli standard generici della <em>cybersecurity</em>. Tutte le comunicazioni devono essere cifrate utilizzando algoritmi crittografici conformi agli standard dell&#8217;ENISA e alle raccomandazioni dell&#8217;Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale. La gestione delle chiavi crittografiche deve seguire <em>best practice</em> consolidate: utilizzo di <em>Hardware Security Module</em> per la custodia delle chiavi private, rotazione periodica delle chiavi, segregazione rigorosa dei ruoli tra chi genera, chi custodisce e chi autorizza l&#8217;uso delle chiavi. L&#8217;autenticazione degli operatori deve basarsi su meccanismi multi-fattore, con certificati digitali rilasciati e gestiti secondo gli standard eIDAS che garantiscono l&#8217;identità digitale certificata degli operatori.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto cruciale per la <em>digital forensics</em> è la tracciabilità completa di ogni operazione sul sistema. Ogni emissione, ricezione, modifica, accesso ai dati deve essere tracciata in <em>log</em> immutabili con <em>timestamp</em> certificato. Questa tracciabilità non risponde solo a esigenze di sicurezza informatica ma è fondamentale per garantire la <em>chain of custody</em> digitale delle prove: in un eventuale processo, deve essere possibile ricostruire esattamente chi ha avuto accesso a quali dati, quando, da quale terminale, con quale autorizzazione. I <em>log</em> devono essere protetti contro manomissioni attraverso tecniche di firma digitale o <em>blockchain</em>, e conservati per periodi congrui che permettano verifiche <em>ex post</em>.</p>\n<p>La segregazione dei dati sensibili contenuti negli EPOC e nelle risposte deve essere implementata attraverso controlli di accesso granulari basati su <em>Role-Based Access Control</em>. Non basta un semplice sistema di permessi: ogni operatore deve avere accesso esclusivamente ai procedimenti per i quali è specificamente autorizzato, con meccanismi automatici che impediscano accessi non autorizzati anche accidentali. Il sistema deve inoltre garantire <em>availability</em> del 99,9%, il che significa al massimo circa otto ore di <em>downtime</em> all&#8217;anno. Considerando che gli EPOC in emergenza devono essere eseguiti entro otto ore, anche poche ore di interruzione del sistema potrebbero tradursi nella perdita di prove critiche. Questo richiede sistemi ridondanti, <em>backup</em> geograficamente distribuiti, procedure di <em>disaster recovery</em> testate periodicamente attraverso simulazioni realistiche.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;intero sistema deve essere progettato secondo i principi di <em>privacy by design</em> e <em>privacy by default</em>, con una <em>Data Protection Impact Assessment</em> obbligatoria che coinvolga attivamente il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali. Ma c&#8217;è un ulteriore livello di complessità: il punto di accesso nazionale non può essere un sistema isolato.</p>\n<p>Deve interfacciarsi con il sistema OEI nazionale per garantire coordinamento e complementarietà tra i due strumenti, evitando che gli investigatori si trovino a dover scegliere tra procedure diverse senza criteri chiari. Deve dialogare con il Sistema Informativo della Cognizione Penale per la gestione dei procedimenti penali, con i sistemi Eurojust e della rete giudiziaria europea per lo scambio di informazioni complementari, con il portale europeo e-Justice per l&#8217;accesso alle informazioni pubbliche sul sistema.</p>\n<p>Il rischio concreto è creare l&#8217;ennesimo sistema a sé stante, un&#8217;isola tecnologica che richiede <em>login</em> separati, interfacce diverse, flussi di lavoro ridondanti. L&#8217;integrazione con i sistemi esistenti è cruciale non solo per l&#8217;efficienza operativa ma anche per garantire che gli strumenti vengano effettivamente utilizzati dagli operatori sul campo. La legge di delegazione impone al Governo di provvedere all&#8217;adozione delle misure necessarie a garantire la piena funzionalità del sistema informatico nazionale, il che significa investimenti significativi non solo in <em>hardware</em> e <em>software</em> ma anche in formazione degli operatori. La <em>governance</em> del sistema dovrà coinvolgere Ministero della Giustizia, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale, AGID, con ruoli e responsabilità chiaramente definiti e meccanismi di coordinamento efficaci.</p>\n<h3>Procedure di riesame e tutela dei diritti: il difficile equilibrio</h3>\n<p>Uno degli aspetti più delicati del sistema E-Evidence, che solleva le maggiori perplessità tra i garantisti e gli esperti di diritti fondamentali, riguarda i meccanismi di riesame e tutela dei diritti. Il modello «orizzontale» che bypassa l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione rischia di indebolire le garanzie processuali se non viene adeguatamente bilanciato attraverso altri meccanismi di controllo. Il regolamento cerca questo equilibrio attraverso un sistema articolato di obiezioni, notifiche e ricorsi, ma l&#8217;efficacia concreta dipenderà dalle scelte implementative degli Stati membri.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;articolo 14 del regolamento prevede che i prestatori di servizi possano sollevare obiezioni motivate all&#8217;esecuzione di un EPOC in diverse circostanze: quando l&#8217;ordine non è stato emesso o convalidato da un&#8217;autorità competente secondo il regolamento; quando l&#8217;ordine è manifestamente al di fuori dell&#8217;ambito di applicazione del regolamento, ad esempio perché richiede dati per finalità non penali; quando l&#8217;ordine viola manifestamente la Carta dei diritti fondamentali dell&#8217;UE o è manifestamente arbitrario; quando esistono conflitti con obblighi previsti dalla legislazione di paesi terzi dove i dati sono fisicamente conservati.</p>\n<p>Quest&#8217;ultimo caso è particolarmente delicato: se un <em>provider</em> americano conserva dati su server negli Stati Uniti e riceve un EPOC che richiede quei dati, potrebbe trovarsi in conflitto tra gli obblighi europei e le disposizioni del CLOUD Act americano.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve individuare l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria competente per il riesame di queste obiezioni ai sensi dell&#8217;articolo 17 del regolamento. La scelta più logica appare essere il Tribunale del Riesame, già competente per questioni analoghe in ambito interno relative al sequestro e all&#8217;acquisizione di prove, ma il decreto potrebbe anche prevedere un giudice specializzato considerata la complessità tecnico-giuridica delle questioni. Un giudice chiamato a valutare un&#8217;obiezione basata su un conflitto con la legislazione di un paese terzo deve avere competenze che vanno oltre il tradizionale diritto processuale penale: deve comprendere i principi di diritto internazionale privato, le questioni di giurisdizione extraterritoriale, gli aspetti tecnici di localizzazione dei dati in architetture <em>cloud</em> distribuite.</p>\n<p>Parallelamente, l&#8217;articolo 15 del regolamento impone che la persona i cui dati sono stati richiesti sia informata della richiesta, salvo quando la notifica possa compromettere l&#8217;indagine. Il decreto deve definire con precisione le tempistiche per la notifica quando non differita, il contenuto dell&#8217;informativa specificando quali elementi devono essere comunicati, i meccanismi di ricorso effettivo dinanzi alle autorità giudiziarie dello Stato di emissione, le procedure per l&#8217;accesso, la rettifica e la cancellazione dei dati compatibilmente con le esigenze investigative.</p>\n<p>Questo diritto all&#8217;informazione è fondamentale perché permette alla persona interessata di attivarsi per la tutela dei propri diritti, ma al contempo può compromettere l&#8217;efficacia dell&#8217;indagine se esercitato prematuramente. Il bilanciamento tra questi interessi confliggenti richiede criteri oggettivi e verificabili, non rimessi alla mera discrezionalità dell&#8217;autorità inquirente.</p>\n<p>Un ultimo livello di garanzia è rappresentato dal sistema di notifica agli Stati membri previsto per i dati più invasivi. Per i dati relativi alle operazioni e ai contenuti, salvo casi specifici dove è evidente che il reato è stato commesso nel paese di emissione o la persona interessata risiede in quel territorio, lo Stato di emissione deve notificare l&#8217;EPOC allo Stato di esecuzione dove si trova lo stabilimento designato o il rappresentante legale del <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Lo Stato di esecuzione ha dieci giorni per sollevare eventuali motivi di rifiuto: immunità o privilegi secondo il proprio diritto, rischio per la sicurezza nazionale o per altri interessi essenziali, <em>ne bis in idem</em> se la persona è già stata giudicata per gli stessi fatti, conflitto con principi fondamentali del proprio ordinamento costituzionale. Questo meccanismo rappresenta un residuo di cooperazione «verticale» all&#8217;interno del modello orizzontale, una valvola di sicurezza per proteggere gli interessi fondamentali degli Stati membri. Il decreto italiano deve definire quale autorità nazionale gestisce queste notifiche in arrivo e valuta l&#8217;eventuale sollevazione di motivi di rifiuto, con procedure rapide che non vanifichino l&#8217;obiettivo di celerità del sistema ma che garantiscano al contempo una valutazione seria e approfondita.</p>\n<h3>L&#8217;obbligo di rappresentanza: ridisegnare la presenza dei <em>provider</em> nell&#8217;UE</h3>\n<p>La Direttiva UE 2023/1544, che l&#8217;Atto del Governo 330 deve recepire entro il 18 febbraio 2026, introduce un obbligo che può apparire tecnico ma che ha implicazioni profonde sul modo in cui i <em>provider</em> globali operano nel mercato europeo. I prestatori di servizi che offrono servizi nell&#8217;Unione Europea, anche se non fisicamente stabiliti sul territorio, devono designare uno «stabilimento designato» o nominare un «rappresentante legale» in almeno uno Stato membro dell&#8217;UE. Questa previsione ribalta il principio tradizionale per cui un&#8217;impresa non stabilita in un territorio non è soggetta alla giurisdizione di quel territorio: qui si impone un obbligo di presenza, sia pure attraverso un rappresentante, come condizione per operare nel mercato europeo.</p>\n<p>Il perimetro applicativo della direttiva è ampio. Rientrano nell&#8217;obbligo i fornitori di reti e servizi di comunicazione elettronica, dai tradizionali operatori telefonici ai <em>provider</em> di servizi internet, dai servizi VoIP come Skype o WhatsApp ai servizi di messaggistica istantanea. Sono inclusi i prestatori di servizi della società dell&#8217;informazione: <em>social media</em> come Facebook, Twitter, Instagram; piattaforme di <em>video-sharing</em> come YouTube o TikTok; servizi di <em>cloud storage</em> come Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive; <em>provider</em> di email come Gmail o Outlook.com; piattaforme e-commerce come Amazon o eBay. Infine, ricadono nell&#8217;obbligo i prestatori di servizi finanziari: banche <em>online</em>, servizi di pagamento elettronico come PayPal o Stripe, piattaforme di <em>trading</em>, servizi di <em>wallet</em> digitale per criptovalute.</p>\n<p>Le esclusioni sono significative e rispondono a logiche di proporzionalità. Sono esentate le micro-imprese con meno di dieci dipendenti e fatturato annuo inferiore a due milioni di euro, una soglia che esclude le <em>startup</em> in fase iniziale e i piccoli progetti ma che non offre riparo ai <em>player</em> consolidati.</p>\n<p>Sono esclusi i prestatori puramente nazionali che offrono servizi esclusivamente all&#8217;interno di un singolo Stato membro, anche se la verifica di questo requisito può essere complessa nell&#8217;era di internet dove anche un servizio pensato per un mercato locale può essere tecnicamente accessibile da qualsiasi parte del mondo. Infine, sono esclusi i servizi dove la conservazione dei dati è puramente accessoria rispetto all&#8217;attività principale, come nel caso di professionisti quali avvocati, architetti, ingegneri o contabili che forniscono servizi <em>online</em> ma la cui attività principale non è digitale.</p>\n<p>La sfida per il decreto italiano sarà applicare queste categorie a modelli di <em>business</em> ibridi o innovativi che non rientrano facilmente nelle classificazioni tradizionali. Un <em>influencer</em> con milioni di <em>follower</em> che monetizza contenuti attraverso una piattaforma proprietaria è un prestatore di servizi della società dell&#8217;informazione? Un&#8217;applicazione di <em>dating</em> con funzionalità di messaggistica integrata rientra nell&#8217;obbligo perché offre un servizio di comunicazione elettronica? Una piattaforma di <em>gaming online</em> con chat tra giocatori deve nominare un rappresentante legale? Il decreto dovrà fornire criteri interpretativi chiari, possibilmente attraverso esempi concreti o una casistica di riferimento, per evitare incertezze che potrebbero tradursi in contenziosi.</p>\n<h3>Rappresentante legale vs stabilimento designato: una scelta strategica</h3>\n<p>La direttiva lascia ai prestatori la scelta tra due modalità di adempimento dell&#8217;obbligo. Lo stabilimento designato è un&#8217;entità del <em>provider</em> già presente nell&#8217;UE – una filiale, una succursale, un ufficio – che viene formalmente designata come punto di contatto per ricevere e dare seguito agli ordini europei. Questa opzione presenta vantaggi in termini di integrazione con la struttura aziendale esistente e di accesso diretto ai sistemi e alle banche dati del <em>provider</em>, ma presuppone che il <em>provider</em> abbia già una presenza fisica significativa nell&#8217;UE, il che non è scontato per molti <em>player</em> extra-europei.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;alternativa è la nomina di un rappresentante legale, una persona fisica o giuridica distinta dal <em>provider</em> che viene incaricata di fungere da interfaccia. Può essere un grande studio legale specializzato in diritto digitale e cooperazione giudiziaria internazionale, un <em>service provider</em> dedicato che offre servizi di rappresentanza legale per conto di multipli clienti, un consulente esterno con le competenze necessarie. Questa opzione offre flessibilità ed è particolarmente adatta per <em>provider</em> extra-UE senza presenza fisica, ma solleva interrogativi sulla reale capacità del rappresentante di dare seguito agli ordini se non ha accesso diretto ai sistemi del <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Ed è proprio qui che la direttiva introduce una previsione cruciale: l&#8217;articolo 3, paragrafo 4, impone che il rappresentante legale o lo stabilimento designato abbiano «i poteri e le risorse necessari per ottemperare» agli ordini europei. Non si tratta quindi di una semplice nomina formale, di una casella postale o di un <em>front office</em> che inoltra le richieste alla casa madre. Il rappresentante deve avere accesso tecnico effettivo ai sistemi del <em>provider</em> per recuperare i dati richiesti, il che implica accordi contrattuali dettagliati, interfacce tecniche sicure, credenziali di accesso privilegiate.</p>\n<p>Deve disporre di competenza tecnico-legale, con personale esperto sia in <em>digital forensics</em> e <em>data management</em> che in diritto processuale penale e <em>data protection</em>. Deve avere capacità operativa H24/7 per gestire le richieste di emergenza che richiedono risposta entro otto ore, il che significa turni continui, reperibilità costante, processi organizzativi rodati e testati. Deve avere risorse finanziarie adeguate per sostenere i costi operativi non trascurabili di un sistema di questo tipo.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve chiarire gli standard minimi richiesti per considerare adeguati i poteri e le risorse del rappresentante. Un rappresentante legale che dichiara formalmente di avere i poteri necessari ma che nella pratica non riesce ad accedere ai dati o che impiega settimane per ottenere risposte dalla casa madre rende l&#8217;intero meccanismo inefficace. Potrebbe essere opportuno prevedere un sistema di accreditamento o certificazione dei rappresentanti legali, con verifiche periodiche della loro effettiva capacità operativa. D&#8217;altra parte, standard troppo stringenti potrebbero scoraggiare i <em>provider</em> dall&#8217;offrire servizi nel mercato europeo o spingere verso soluzioni di <em>compliance</em> meramente formali.</p>\n<h3>Responsabilità solidale: un meccanismo controverso ma necessario</h3>\n<p>Uno degli aspetti più discussi della direttiva è la previsione di responsabilità solidale tra il prestatore di servizi e il rappresentante legale o lo stabilimento designato per l&#8217;inottemperanza agli obblighi. L&#8217;articolo 3, paragrafo 5, stabilisce che entrambi possono essere ritenuti responsabili e che non può essere invocata «la mancanza di procedure interne adeguate» tra <em>provider</em> e rappresentante come giustificazione dell&#8217;inottemperanza. Questa previsione risponde a un&#8217;esigenza pratica comprensibile: evitare che <em>provider</em> e rappresentanti si «scarichino» reciprocamente la responsabilità, con il <em>provider</em> che sostiene di aver fornito tutti i dati al rappresentante e il rappresentante che afferma di non aver ricevuto collaborazione dal <em>provider</em>, mentre l&#8217;autorità inquirente rimane senza le prove necessarie.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, la responsabilità solidale solleva questioni complesse che il decreto italiano dovrà affrontare. Come si coordina questo meccanismo con i principi costituzionali di personalità della responsabilità penale e amministrativa? Se il rappresentante legale è uno studio legale esterno che ha adempiuto diligentemente ai propri obblighi contrattuali ma il <em>provider</em>, che ha sede in un paese extra-UE, si rifiuta di fornire i dati, è giusto sanzionare anche il rappresentante? Viceversa, se il <em>provider</em> ha fornito tempestivamente tutti i dati richiesti ma il rappresentante, per negligenza o incapacità organizzativa, non li trasmette all&#8217;autorità richiedente, il <em>provider</em> deve subire le conseguenze?</p>\n<p>La soluzione probabilmente risiede in una graduazione della responsabilità basata sull&#8217;effettivo controllo sulla situazione e sulla possibilità concreta di adempiere. Il rappresentante legale dovrebbe rispondere pienamente quando l&#8217;inottemperanza dipende da inefficienze nella sua organizzazione o da sua negligenza, ma dovrebbe avere la possibilità di dimostrare di aver fatto tutto il possibile per ottenere i dati dal <em>provider</em>. Simmetricamente, il <em>provider</em> dovrebbe rispondere pienamente quando si rifiuta di collaborare con il proprio rappresentante o quando le «procedure interne» sono volutamente farraginose per rendere difficile l&#8217;esecuzione degli ordini. La responsabilità dovrebbe essere effettivamente solidale solo quando entrambi hanno contribuito all&#8217;inottemperanza o quando non è possibile determinare dove risieda la responsabilità principale.</p>\n<p>Il regime sanzionatorio disegnato dal regolamento 2023/1543 prevede sanzioni pecuniarie fino al due per cento del fatturato mondiale annuo totale dell&#8217;esercizio precedente per i <em>provider</em> che non rispettano gli ordini europei, mentre la direttiva 2023/1544 richiede sanzioni «effettive, proporzionate e dissuasive» per la violazione degli obblighi di designazione o nomina e per l&#8217;inottemperanza. Per comprendere la portata di queste cifre, si consideri che per un gigante tecnologico come Meta il due per cento del fatturato mondiale può significare oltre due miliardi di dollari. Si tratta di sanzioni potenzialmente devastanti, pensate per essere realmente deterrenti anche per i <em>player</em> globali che potrebbero essere tentati di ignorare le richieste europee.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano deve definire diversi aspetti fondamentali di questo regime sanzionatorio. Innanzitutto, la natura delle sanzioni: saranno puramente amministrative o si configureranno reati in casi particolarmente gravi, ad esempio quando l&#8217;inottemperanza è dolosa e finalizzata a favorire attività criminali? In secondo luogo, l&#8217;autorità competente per l&#8217;irrogazione: il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali, che ha già esperienza con sanzioni significative in ambito GDPR? L&#8217;autorità giudiziaria che ha emesso l&#8217;EPOC non eseguito? Un&#8217;autorità amministrativa dedicata?</p>\n<p>La graduazione delle sanzioni dovrà tenere conto della gravità della violazione, distinguendo tra ritardi nella risposta e rifiuti espliciti, tra prime violazioni e comportamenti reiterati, tra situazioni di impossibilità oggettiva debitamente documentata e mancanza di collaborazione. Dovranno essere previste circostanze attenuanti per situazioni di reale impossibilità tecnica, per i casi di prima violazione quando seguita da immediata correzione, per i <em>provider</em> che dimostrano piena cooperazione anche se non riescono a fornire tutti i dati richiesti nei tempi previsti.</p>\n<p>Infine, e questo è cruciale per la legittimità del sistema, devono essere garantiti il diritto di difesa e meccanismi di ricorso effettivo. Un <em>provider</em> sanzionato deve avere la possibilità di contestare la sanzione dinanzi a un giudice indipendente, di dimostrare l&#8217;impossibilità di esecuzione, di fornire elementi a propria discolpa. Il rischio, altrimenti, è che sanzioni tanto elevate vengano considerate sproporzionate dalla giurisprudenza europea, rendendo l&#8217;intero sistema inefficace.</p>\n<h3>Impatto operativo: costi, opportunità e trasformazioni di mercato</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;implementazione del sistema E-Evidence comporta costi significativi per i prestatori di servizi che vanno ben oltre l&#8217;aspetto meramente finanziario, incidendo sull&#8217;organizzazione aziendale, sui processi operativi, sulle strategie di mercato. I costi di <em>setup</em> iniziale includono la nomina o designazione del rappresentante legale o stabilimento designato, con tutti gli adempimenti legali e contrattuali connessi. Occorre sviluppare interfacce tecniche con il sistema informatico decentrato, il che significa progetti di integrazione <em>software</em> complessi che devono garantire sicurezza, affidabilità e conformità agli standard europei.</p>\n<p>I sistemi interni di <em>data retention</em> e <em>retrieval</em> devono essere adeguati per permettere l&#8217;estrazione rapida ed efficiente dei dati nelle categorie previste dal regolamento, con particolare attenzione alla capacità di rispettare i tempi stringenti di otto ore per le emergenze. Il personale deve essere formato non solo sugli aspetti tecnici ma anche su quelli giuridici, perché chi gestisce le richieste deve essere in grado di comprendere le implicazioni legali di ogni categoria di dati e di valutare la legittimità formale degli ordini ricevuti.</p>\n<p>I costi ricorrenti sono altrettanto rilevanti. Ogni richiesta richiede analisi legale per verificare la conformità formale dell&#8217;ordine, estrazione tecnica dei dati che può essere semplice per i <em>subscriber data</em> ma estremamente complessa per ricostruzioni di dati storici o per dati conservati in architetture distribuite, preparazione delle risposte in formati strutturati e sicuri. Il mantenimento della disponibilità H24/7 implica costi di personale significativi, con turni di reperibilità e procedure di escalation. Gli aggiornamenti tecnici e normativi sono continui in un settore in rapidissima evoluzione, e il sistema deve essere costantemente adeguato. Infine, le attività di <em>auditing</em> e <em>compliance</em> per dimostrare la conformità agli obblighi richiedono risorse dedicate.</p>\n<p>Per i grandi <em>provider</em> questi costi sono sostenibili e probabilmente già parzialmente ammortizzati attraverso le strutture esistenti per gestire richieste di autorità nazionali attraverso canali tradizionali. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon hanno già team dedicati alla <em>law enforcement compliance</em> con processi consolidati, anche se dovranno adeguarli alle specificità del sistema E-Evidence. Per <em>provider</em> medio-piccoli, invece, questi costi possono rappresentare una barriera significativa che potrebbe scoraggiarli dall&#8217;offrire servizi nel mercato europeo o spingerli verso modelli di <em>business</em> che eludono formalmente l&#8217;applicazione della direttiva. Il rischio concreto è un effetto di concentrazione di mercato, dove i <em>player</em> dominanti vengono ulteriormente rafforzati perché hanno le risorse per gestire la <em>compliance</em> mentre i concorrenti più piccoli vengono marginalizzati.</p>\n<p>Questo scenario potrebbe però aprire opportunità di <em>business</em> interessanti. Si sta già sviluppando un mercato di «E-Evidence <em>Compliance as a Service</em>», con società specializzate che offrono servizi di rappresentanza legale e gestione delle richieste per conto di multiple <em>provider</em>.</p>\n<p>Il modello è simile a quello dei <em>Data Protection Officer as a Service</em> emerso con il GDPR: un <em>provider</em> specializzato che mette a disposizione le competenze, le infrastrutture, i processi necessari serve multiple clienti, distribuendo i costi fissi e rendendo la <em>compliance</em> accessibile anche a realtà più piccole.</p>\n<p>Questo modello potrebbe abbassare significativamente le barriere all&#8217;ingresso, ma solleva questioni di qualità del servizio e di tutela dei dati, perché i <em>provider</em> delegano al fornitore esterno l&#8217;accesso a dati potenzialmente molto sensibili dei propri utenti.</p>\n<h2><em>Digital forensics</em> transfrontaliera: l&#8217;anello critico della catena probatoria</h2>\n<h3><em>Chain of custody</em> in ambiente transfrontaliero: preservare l&#8217;integrità attraverso i confini</h3>\n<p>Quando parliamo di prove digitali acquisite attraverso un EPOC, uno degli aspetti più critici da un punto di vista forense è la preservazione della <em>chain of custody</em> attraverso passaggi multipli e giurisdizioni diverse. In ambito nazionale, la catena di custodia delle prove digitali segue protocolli consolidati: dal momento del sequestro o dell&#8217;acquisizione, ogni passaggio deve essere documentato, ogni persona che ha avuto accesso ai dati deve essere identificata, ogni operazione sui dati deve essere tracciata, ogni trasferimento deve essere accompagnato da verbali di consegna. Gli standard internazionali come l&#8217;ISO/IEC 27037 forniscono linee guida dettagliate per l&#8217;identificazione, la raccolta, l&#8217;acquisizione e la preservazione di prove digitali.</p>\n<p>Il sistema E-Evidence introduce una complessità aggiuntiva perché la prova digitale attraversa confini giurisdizionali senza che l&#8217;autorità richiedente abbia controllo diretto sul processo di estrazione. I dati vengono estratti dai sistemi del <em>provider</em>, nello Stato di esecuzione, da personale del <em>provider</em> o del rappresentante legale che opera secondo procedure proprie, possibilmente diverse da quelle dello Stato richiedente. I dati vengono quindi trasmessi attraverso il sistema informatico decentrato, subendo processi di crittografia, trasferimento su reti, decrittografia. Infine, arrivano all&#8217;autorità richiedente che deve verificarne l&#8217;autenticità e l&#8217;integrità prima di utilizzarli nel procedimento.</p>\n<p>Come garantire che in questo processo articolato le prove mantengano le caratteristiche di genuinità, autenticità e integrità richieste per la loro utilizzabilità processuale? La risposta risiede in una combinazione di misure tecniche e procedurali.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista tecnico, l&#8217;utilizzo di funzioni di <em>hash</em> crittografiche come SHA-256 o SHA-3 permette di generare un&#8217;impronta digitale univoca dei dati al momento dell&#8217;estrazione. Questa impronta viene allegata ai dati trasmessi e l&#8217;autorità ricevente può ricalcolarla sui dati ricevuti: se le due impronte coincidono, è matematicamente certo che i dati non sono stati alterati durante la trasmissione. Il <em>timestamping</em> certificato, basato su servizi di <em>timestamping</em> qualificati ai sensi del regolamento eIDAS, permette di provare che i dati esistevano in una certa forma in un momento specifico, rendendo impossibile retrodatazioni o modifiche.</p>\n<p>I <em>metadata</em> originali dei file devono essere preservati integralmente perché possono contenere informazioni forensi cruciali: data e ora di creazione, data e ora di ultima modifica, autore del documento, versioni precedenti, dati EXIF per le immagini che includono informazioni sulla fotocamera e sulla geolocalizzazione. Il formato di trasmissione deve essere <em>forense-friendly</em>, preferibilmente formati aperti e documentati che permettano verifiche indipendenti. Le firme digitali apposte dal sistema informatico decentrato ad ogni passaggio creano una catena di autenticazione verificabile.</p>\n<p>Dal punto di vista procedurale, è fondamentale che ogni attore della catena documenti dettagliatamente le proprie operazioni. Il <em>provider</em> o il rappresentante legale che estrae i dati deve generare un <em>report</em> tecnico che descriva: quali sistemi sono stati interrogati, quali <em>query</em> sono state eseguite, in quale formato sono stati estratti i dati, quali <em>hash</em> sono stati calcolati, chi ha effettuato materialmente l&#8217;estrazione, quando è avvenuta l&#8217;operazione. Il sistema informatico decentrato deve generare <em>log</em> completi che documentino ogni passaggio della trasmissione. L&#8217;autorità ricevente deve verificare formalmente l&#8217;integrità dei dati ricevuti ricalcolando gli <em>hash</em>, controllando le firme digitali, validando i <em>timestamp</em>, e deve documentare queste verifiche in un verbale che entrerà a far parte del fascicolo processuale.</p>\n<p>La sfida è standardizzare queste procedure tra Stati membri con tradizioni processuali diverse. Un investigatore italiano deve poter fidarsi che i dati estratti da un <em>provider</em> secondo le procedure tedesche o francesi o svedesi rispettino standard forensi equivalenti a quelli italiani. Questo richiede un lavoro di armonizzazione che va oltre le norme giuridiche e coinvolge le <em>best practice</em> tecniche, la formazione degli operatori, la certificazione dei processi.</p>\n<h3>I tempi di risposta come variabile critica: tra efficienza e qualità</h3>\n<p>Il regolamento stabilisce tempi di risposta stringenti: dieci giorni per un EPOC standard, riducibili a otto ore in caso di emergenza debitamente accertata. Questi tempi rappresentano un drammatico miglioramento rispetto ai mesi necessari per le rogatorie tradizionali o alle settimane dell&#8217;OEI, ma introducono tensioni con le esigenze di accuratezza e completezza proprie della <em>digital forensics</em>. Un&#8217;estrazione di dati frettolosa, eseguita sotto la pressione di una scadenza di otto ore, può comportare errori, omissioni, perdita di <em>metadata</em>, contaminazione di prove.</p>\n<p>Le otto ore per le emergenze sono pensate per situazioni dove il pericolo di perdita delle prove è imminente: un sospetto di terrorismo che potrebbe rendersi conto di essere sotto investigazione e cancellare tutti i suoi <em>account</em>; una vittima di sequestro di persona dove le comunicazioni del sequestratore potrebbero fornire indizi sulla localizzazione; un attacco informatico in corso dove i <em>log</em> potrebbero essere cancellati. In questi casi, la velocità è effettivamente prioritaria rispetto alla perfezione forense, secondo il principio che una prova imperfetta è meglio di nessuna prova. Ma questa logica non può essere estesa indiscriminatamente: l&#8217;emergenza deve essere reale, documentata, verificabile <em>ex post</em>.</p>\n<p>I dieci giorni per le richieste standard rappresentano un compromesso più ragionevole che dovrebbe permettere estrazioni accurate, ma anche qui ci sono criticità. Per dati semplici come <em>subscriber data</em> o <em>access data</em> limitati nel tempo, dieci giorni sono abbondanti.</p>\n<p>Ma se l&#8217;EPOC richiede, ad esempio, tutti i contenuti di un <em>account</em> email attivo da anni con decine di migliaia di messaggi, o tutti i file conservati in un <em>account</em> di <em>cloud storage</em> che contiene terabyte di dati, o una ricostruzione completa delle comunicazioni di un utente su un <em>social network</em> nell&#8217;arco di mesi, dieci giorni possono essere insufficienti per un&#8217;estrazione completa e accurata. Il regolamento prevede la possibilità per il <em>provider</em> di chiedere una proroga in casi di impossibilità tecnica, ma questa deve essere motivata e documentata, e non è detto che venga concessa.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto spesso sottovalutato riguarda la qualità dei dati ricevuti. Non basta che il <em>provider</em> trasmetta dei dati entro i termini: i dati devono essere completi, accurati, utilizzabili. Se arrivano dati parziali, o in formati proprietari non facilmente analizzabili, o senza adeguata documentazione tecnica che permetta di interpretarli correttamente, l&#8217;utilità investigativa è compromessa.</p>\n<p>Il regolamento non specifica in dettaglio i requisiti tecnici per il formato di trasmissione dei dati, rimandando a standard che dovranno essere sviluppati nell&#8217;ambito del sistema informatico decentrato. Questa standardizzazione è cruciale: un investigatore che riceve un file di <em>log</em> di accesso deve sapere come interpretare ogni campo, quale <em>timezone</em> sia utilizzato per i <em>timestamp</em>, come siano codificati gli indirizzi IP se compressi, quale sia il significato di eventuali <em>flag</em> o codici.</p>\n<h3>Competenze richieste: oltre il tradizionale perito informatico</h3>\n<p>L&#8217;utilizzo efficace del sistema E-Evidence richiede competenze che vanno ben oltre quelle del tradizionale investigatore o del perito informatico. Gli organi investigativi devono sviluppare capacità di formulare richieste tecnicamente precise, il che significa comprendere a fondo la distinzione tra le diverse categorie di dati e le loro implicazioni. Non è più sufficiente chiedere genericamente «tutti i dati relativi all&#8217;utente X»: bisogna specificare se si richiedono <em>subscriber data</em>, <em>access data</em>, <em>transactional data</em>, <em>content data</em>, e per ciascuna categoria quali elementi specifici sono rilevanti per l&#8217;indagine.</p>\n<p>Un investigatore che sta seguendo un caso di frode <em>online</em> potrebbe aver bisogno dei <em>subscriber data</em> per identificare il titolare dell&#8217;<em>account</em>, degli <em>access data</em> per determinare da dove e quando l&#8217;<em>account</em> è stato utilizzato, dei <em>transactional data</em> per ricostruire le comunicazioni con le vittime, dei <em>content data</em> per acquisire i messaggi in cui è stata perfezionata la truffa. Ma deve sapere che richiedere i <em>content data</em> comporta un livello di tutela più elevato, tempi potenzialmente più lunghi, maggiori possibilità di obiezioni. Deve valutare se i <em>transactional data</em>, che possono già rivelare molto sulla rete di contatti, siano sufficienti per quella fase dell&#8217;indagine, lasciando eventualmente i <em>content data</em> a una richiesta successiva quando ci saranno elementi più solidi.</p>\n<p>La competenza tecnica deve estendersi alla comprensione delle architetture dei servizi investigati. I dati su un servizio di email tradizionale sono strutturati diversamente da quelli su un servizio di messaggistica <em>end-to-end encrypted</em>.</p>\n<p>Un <em>social network</em> organizza i dati in modi che riflettono la sua particolare architettura: post pubblici, post condivisi con gruppi specifici, messaggi privati, reazioni, commenti, <em>metadata</em> di geolocalizzazione, connessioni tra utenti. Un servizio di <em>cloud storage</em> può conservare non solo i file attuali ma anche versioni precedenti, file cancellati ancora presenti in cestini o <em>backup</em>, <em>metadata</em> di condivisione. Richiedere «tutti i dati» senza specificare può portare a ricevere una massa enorme di informazioni difficile da analizzare, oppure a ricevere solo una parte dei dati effettivamente rilevanti perché il <em>provider</em> interpreta la richiesta in senso restrittivo.</p>\n<p>Questa complessità implica necessità formative significative. Gli investigatori devono essere formati non solo sugli aspetti giuridici del sistema E-Evidence ma anche sugli aspetti tecnici dei servizi digitali più comuni. I magistrati che devono convalidare gli EPOC o valutare le obiezioni dei <em>provider</em> devono avere competenze che vanno oltre il diritto processuale penale tradizionale, includendo elementi di diritto digitale, <em>data protection</em>, giurisdizione internazionale, tecnologie informatiche. I periti e i consulenti tecnici che analizzano i dati ricevuti devono avere familiarità con i formati di <em>export</em> dei principali <em>provider</em> e con le tecniche di analisi forense di grandi volumi di dati digitali.</p>\n<h3>E-Evidence e OEI: complementarietà o sovrapposizione?</h3>\n<p>Una delle questioni operative più delicate riguarda il rapporto tra il sistema E-Evidence e l&#8217;Ordine Europeo di Indagine. Entrambi gli strumenti sono destinati a coesistere, ma con ambiti di applicazione e logiche diverse che possono creare confusione negli operatori. L&#8217;OEI è uno strumento generalista che copre qualsiasi atto di indagine penale in ambito transfrontaliero: intercettazioni in tempo reale, perquisizioni e sequestri, assunzioni di testimoni, accertamenti tecnici, e ovviamente anche l&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali. Il sistema E-Evidence è invece uno strumento specialistico focalizzato esclusivamente sull&#8217;acquisizione di prove digitali già conservate dai <em>provider</em> di servizi.</p>\n<p>La logica dell&#8217;OEI rimane quella della cooperazione verticale tra autorità giudiziarie: l&#8217;autorità di emissione invia l&#8217;OEI all&#8217;autorità di esecuzione che lo esegue secondo le proprie procedure nazionali. Questo significa che l&#8217;autorità di esecuzione mantiene un controllo sull&#8217;esecuzione dell&#8217;atto investigativo, può sollevare motivi di rifiuto, può ricorrere a atti di indagine diversi da quello richiesto se permettono di ottenere lo stesso risultato con mezzi meno intrusivi. Il sistema E-Evidence introduce invece la cooperazione orizzontale dove l&#8217;autorità richiedente si rivolge direttamente al <em>provider</em>, bypassando l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione salvo il meccanismo di notifica per i dati più invasivi.</p>\n<p>In teoria, la scelta tra i due strumenti dovrebbe basarsi sulla natura dell&#8217;atto investigativo richiesto. Se si tratta di acquisire prove digitali già conservate da un <em>provider</em> che ha uno stabilimento designato o un rappresentante legale nell&#8217;UE, lo strumento appropriato è l&#8217;EPOC. Se invece l&#8217;atto investigativo richiede un&#8217;attività materiale sul territorio dello Stato di esecuzione – una perquisizione di locali fisici, un sequestro di dispositivi <em>hardware</em>, un&#8217;intercettazione in tempo reale di comunicazioni – lo strumento appropriato rimane l&#8217;OEI. Se l&#8217;obiettivo è acquisire prove digitali da un soggetto che non è un <em>provider</em> di servizi rientrante nell&#8217;ambito della direttiva 2023/1544 – ad esempio, acquisire i dispositivi informatici di un&#8217;azienda sospettata di frode – l&#8217;OEI rimane lo strumento necessario.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, nella pratica le situazioni possono essere più ambigue. Si consideri il caso di un&#8217;indagine su un reato commesso utilizzando un servizio di <em>cloud storage</em>. L&#8217;investigatore potrebbe voler acquisire sia i file conservati sul <em>cloud</em> (accessibili tramite EPOC) sia il dispositivo fisico da cui l&#8217;utente accedeva al servizio (che richiederebbe un OEI per la perquisizione e il sequestro nello Stato dove si trova il dispositivo). Oppure un&#8217;indagine su traffico di stupefacenti potrebbe richiedere sia i messaggi scambiati su un&#8217;<em>app</em> di messaggistica (EPOC) sia le intercettazioni in tempo reale delle comunicazioni future (OEI). La complementarietà dei due strumenti richiede coordinamento: l&#8217;autorità inquirente deve sviluppare strategie investigative integrate che utilizzino entrambi gli strumenti in modo sinergico.</p>\n<p>C&#8217;è poi una zona grigia rappresentata dai casi in cui sarebbe tecnicamente possibile utilizzare entrambi gli strumenti. Se un&#8217;autorità italiana vuole acquisire i contenuti dell&#8217;<em>account</em> email di un indagato, e l&#8217;email <em>provider</em> ha un rappresentante legale in Germania, può emettere un EPOC indirizzato direttamente al rappresentante legale.</p>\n<p>Ma potrebbe anche, in teoria, emettere un OEI verso l&#8217;autorità giudiziaria tedesca chiedendo di acquisire quegli stessi dati. Quale strumento dovrebbe essere preferito? La logica del sistema E-Evidence suggerisce che, quando applicabile, l&#8217;EPOC dovrebbe essere lo strumento primario perché più rapido ed efficiente. Ma ci potrebbero essere situazioni in cui l&#8217;autorità richiedente preferisce passare attraverso l&#8217;OEI perché ritiene importante il controllo dell&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione, ad esempio in casi particolarmente delicati o controversi.</p>\n<p>Il decreto italiano dovrebbe fornire linee guida operative su questi aspetti, possibilmente attraverso circolari interpretative o manuali operativi destinati ai pubblici ministeri e agli investigatori. Dovrebbe chiarire che il sistema E-Evidence non sostituisce l&#8217;OEI ma lo affianca per una categoria specifica di prove, che la scelta tra i due strumenti deve basarsi sulla natura dell&#8217;atto investigativo e sul soggetto da cui si vogliono acquisire le prove, che in situazioni complesse è possibile e anzi auspicabile utilizzare entrambi gli strumenti in modo coordinato.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto procedurale importante riguarda la gestione dei casi in cui un EPOC non produce i risultati attesi: se il <em>provider</em> non è in grado di fornire i dati richiesti, o se fornisce dati parziali o inadeguati, l&#8217;autorità richiedente può «convertire» la richiesta in un OEI rivolgendosi all&#8217;autorità giudiziaria dello Stato di esecuzione per un&#8217;azione più invasiva? Il coordinamento tra i due sistemi deve essere fluido per evitare che le inefficienze di uno strumento non possano essere compensate dall&#8217;altro.</p>\n<h2><em>Privacy</em>, GDPR e proporzionalità: il bilanciamento necessario</h2>\n<p>Il rapporto tra il sistema E-Evidence e il Regolamento Generale sulla Protezione dei Dati è uno dei nodi più delicati e potenzialmente conflittuali dell&#8217;intera architettura normativa. Il regolamento 2023/1543 non deroga al GDPR ma stabilisce una base giuridica specifica per il trattamento dei dati personali nell&#8217;ambito dei procedimenti penali, richiamando l&#8217;articolo 23 del GDPR che permette limitazioni dei diritti degli interessati quando necessarie per la prevenzione, l&#8217;indagine e il perseguimento di reati. Tuttavia, anche quando opera questa base giuridica, rimangono fermi i principi fondamentali della protezione dati: necessità, proporzionalità, finalità limitata, minimizzazione dei dati, conservazione limitata nel tempo.</p>\n<p>Ogni EPOC deve rispettare il principio di necessità, nel senso che i dati richiesti devono essere effettivamente necessari per l&#8217;indagine in corso e non acquisibili con mezzi meno invasivi.</p>\n<p>Non è legittimo richiedere «tutti i dati» disponibili su un <em>account</em> per poi selezionare <em>a posteriori</em> quelli rilevanti: la richiesta deve essere specifica e mirata. Il principio di proporzionalità richiede che l&#8217;invasività della richiesta sia bilanciata con la gravità del reato investigato. Il regolamento stesso incorpora questo principio prevedendo che gli EPOC per i dati più invasivi (<em>transactional</em> e <em>content data</em>) possano essere emessi solo per reati punibili con pena detentiva massima di almeno tre anni, o per specifici reati informatici, di terrorismo o contro la sicurezza cibernetica indipendentemente dalla pena prevista.</p>\n<p>Il principio di finalità limitata impone che i dati acquisiti tramite EPOC possano essere utilizzati esclusivamente per il procedimento penale per cui sono stati richiesti, e non per altri scopi. Se durante l&#8217;analisi dei dati emergono indizi di reati diversi da quello per cui è stato emesso l&#8217;EPOC, la loro utilizzabilità come prova per questi altri reati è questione delicata che richiederà l&#8217;intervento della giurisprudenza. In ambito nazionale, la Corte di Cassazione ha elaborato la dottrina delle «scoperte fortuite» nel contesto delle intercettazioni, ma l&#8217;applicazione di questi principi ai dati acquisiti tramite EPOC presenta specificità che dovranno essere chiarite.</p>\n<p>La minimizzazione dei dati richiede che vengano acquisiti solo i dati strettamente necessari. Se è sufficiente conoscere con chi un indagato ha comunicato e quando (<em>transactional data</em>), non è proporzionato richiedere anche il contenuto delle comunicazioni. Se è sufficiente sapere da quale indirizzo IP un <em>account</em> è stato utilizzato (<em>access data</em>), non è necessario richiedere tutti i file conservati nell&#8217;<em>account</em>. Questo principio pone oneri significativi sulle autorità richiedenti che devono formulare richieste precise e giustificate, ma anche sui <em>provider</em> che dovrebbero avere la capacità tecnica di estrarre selettivamente solo i dati richiesti senza fornire automaticamente insiemi di dati più ampi.</p>\n<p>Il diritto all&#8217;informazione dell&#8217;interessato, previsto dall&#8217;articolo 15 del regolamento E-Evidence, deve essere effettivo e non meramente formale. La persona deve essere informata in termini comprensibili di quali dati sono stati acquisiti, per quale procedimento, con quale base giuridica, con quali diritti di ricorso. L&#8217;informazione può essere differita quando potrebbe pregiudicare l&#8217;indagine, ma non può essere negata indefinitamente. Il decreto italiano deve stabilire criteri oggettivi per decidere quando differire l&#8217;informazione e per quanto tempo, evitando che il differimento diventi la regola piuttosto che l&#8217;eccezione.</p>\n<p>I diritti di accesso, rettifica e cancellazione dell&#8217;interessato, previsti dal GDPR, devono essere compatibilizzati con le esigenze investigative. Un indagato ha diritto di accedere ai propri dati acquisiti dall&#8217;autorità inquirente? In linea generale, questo diritto si realizza attraverso il diritto di accesso agli atti del procedimento secondo le norme processuali penali, non attraverso i meccanismi del GDPR.</p>\n<p>Ma ci possono essere fasi in cui l&#8217;interessato non è ancora formalmente indagato e quindi non ha accesso agli atti: in questi casi, il GDPR potrebbe offrire tutele aggiuntive. Il diritto alla cancellazione è particolarmente problematico: non può essere invocato per cancellare prove di reato, ma potrebbe applicarsi a dati non rilevanti che sono stati acquisiti ma non sono utilizzati nel procedimento. Il decreto dovrebbe prevedere procedure di revisione periodica dei dati conservati per cancellare quelli non più necessari.</p>\n<h2>Prospettive critiche e rischi sistemici</h2>\n<p>Sarebbe ingenuo pensare che il sistema E-Evidence risolverà magicamente tutti i problemi dell&#8217;acquisizione transfrontaliera di prove digitali. Diverse questioni strutturali rimangono aperte e potrebbero minare l&#8217;efficacia del sistema o generare conseguenze indesiderate.</p>\n<p>La prima incognita riguarda l&#8217;effettiva volontà di <em>compliance</em> dei <em>provider</em>, specialmente quelli extra-europei. I giganti tecnologici americani hanno già team dedicati alla <em>law enforcement compliance</em> e probabilmente si adegueranno, anche se non senza tensioni politiche. Ma <em>provider</em> cinesi, russi, o di altre giurisdizioni con cui l&#8217;UE ha rapporti difficili, potrebbero essere meno cooperativi. Un <em>provider</em> che decide di non nominare un rappresentante legale nell&#8217;UE tecnicamente viola la direttiva e dovrebbe essere sanzionato, ma come imporre concretamente la sanzione a un&#8217;entità che non ha presenza fisica nell&#8217;UE e che potrebbe semplicemente ignorare le richieste europee? L&#8217;unica leva reale sarebbe il <em>blocking</em> del servizio, ma questo solleva questioni di proporzionalità e di impatto sugli utenti europei che utilizzano legittimamente quel servizio.</p>\n<p>La frammentazione geografica dei dati pone sfide tecniche e giuridiche. Molti <em>provider</em> globali utilizzano architetture <em>cloud</em> distribuite dove i dati degli utenti sono replicati su server in diverse giurisdizioni per ragioni di <em>performance</em> e affidabilità. Un utente italiano che utilizza un servizio americano potrebbe avere i propri dati conservati contemporaneamente su server in Irlanda, negli Stati Uniti, a Singapore. Quale copia dei dati viene fornita in risposta a un EPOC? Cosa succede se le diverse copie non sono perfettamente sincronizzate? Il <em>provider</em> è tenuto a fornire tutte le copie o solo una? E se diverse giurisdizioni reclamano obblighi contrastanti su quegli stessi dati?</p>\n<p>Il rischio di <em>weaponization</em> politica del sistema E-Evidence è concreto. Stati membri con standard democratici indeboliti potrebbero utilizzare gli EPOC per perseguire oppositori politici, giornalisti, attivisti. Il sistema di garanzie previsto dal regolamento dovrebbe proteggere contro questi abusi, ma la storia insegna che le garanzie formali non sempre sono sufficienti quando manca la volontà politica di applicarle. I <em>provider</em> potrebbero trovarsi nella difficile posizione di dover valutare se un EPOC formalmente legittimo nasconda in realtà un abuso politico, una valutazione che richiede giudizi delicati su sistemi giuridici stranieri.</p>\n<p>La standardizzazione tecnica tra Stati membri richiederà tempo e investimenti che non tutti i paesi sono egualmente preparati a sostenere. Il rischio è che il sistema funzioni efficacemente tra un nucleo di Stati con infrastrutture avanzate e competenze consolidate, mentre altri Stati rimangano ai margini. Questo potrebbe creare una cooperazione giudiziaria a più velocità, dove gli Stati tecnologicamente avanzati cooperano efficacemente tra loro attraverso E-Evidence mentre gli altri rimangono ancorati a strumenti tradizionali più lenti.</p>\n<p>La pressione sui tempi di risposta potrebbe compromettere la qualità delle prove. L&#8217;enfasi sulla velocità, comprensibile date le esigenze investigative, potrebbe creare incentivi perversi a sacrificare accuratezza e completezza sull&#8217;altare dell&#8217;efficienza. Un&#8217;estrazione frettolosa eseguita per rispettare il termine di otto ore potrebbe perdere <em>metadata</em> cruciali, omettere dati rilevanti, o introdurre errori che compromettono l&#8217;utilizzabilità processuale. Serve un bilanciamento delicato, e la cultura forense deve evolversi per incorporare protocolli di qualità anche in contesti di emergenza.</p>\n<h4>Conclusioni: verso un ecosistema investigativo maturo</h4>\n<p>L&#8217;attuazione del pacchetto E-Evidence attraverso gli schemi di decreto legislativo attualmente all&#8217;esame parlamentare rappresenta un passaggio epocale per il diritto processuale penale europeo e italiano. Non si tratta di una semplice aggiunta di strumenti tecnici alla cassetta degli attrezzi investigativi, ma di un ripensamento profondo di come lo Stato esercita la giurisdizione penale in un mondo digitalizzato dove i confini territoriali hanno perso gran parte del loro significato pratico.</p>\n<p>Per gli operatori del diritto, questo significa acquisire competenze nuove che incrociano diritto processuale, <em>data protection</em>, tecnologie informatiche, cooperazione internazionale. Per le forze di <em>law enforcement</em>, significa riorganizzare processi investigativi consolidati, formare personale specializzato, investire in infrastrutture tecnologiche. Per i CISO e i professionisti della <em>cybersecurity</em> dei <em>provider</em>, significa costruire processi di <em>compliance</em> complessi che bilanciano obblighi legali, tutela della <em>privacy</em> degli utenti, efficienza operativa, rischi reputazionali. Per gli esperti di <em>digital forensics</em>, significa sviluppare metodologie che funzionino in contesti transfrontalieri dove il controllo diretto sull&#8217;acquisizione delle prove è limitato.</p>\n<p>Ma soprattutto, per tutti gli attori dell&#8217;ecosistema, significa mantenere alta la vigilanza sui diritti fondamentali. L&#8217;efficienza investigativa è un valore importante in una società che deve proteggersi dalla criminalità, sempre più organizzata su scala transnazionale e sempre più sofisticata nell&#8217;uso delle tecnologie. Ma questa efficienza non può mai tradursi in un sacrificio ingiustificato della <em>privacy</em>, della libertà di espressione, del diritto alla difesa, delle garanzie processuali che definiscono una democrazia liberale. Il sistema E-Evidence funzionerà veramente solo se saprà essere al contempo efficace nel dare alle autorità gli strumenti per investigare e garantista nel proteggere i diritti delle persone.</p>\n<p>L&#8217;Italia ha l&#8217;opportunità, attraverso gli schemi di decreto attualmente in discussione, di contribuire a costruire un sistema che sia modello di questo equilibrio. Le scelte implementative che verranno fatte nelle prossime settimane e mesi – quali autorità designare, come strutturare i processi di riesame, quali standard di sicurezza imporre al sistema informatico, come graduare le sanzioni, come formare gli operatori – determineranno se il sistema E-Evidence italiano sarà un esempio di cooperazione giudiziaria efficace e rispettosa dei diritti, o se si rivelerà un&#8217;altra occasione mancata.</p>\n<p>Il dibattito tecnico e politico che accompagna l&#8217;esame parlamentare degli schemi di decreto deve essere all&#8217;altezza della posta in gioco. Non può limitarsi a questioni formali di conformità alle norme europee, ma deve affrontare le questioni sostanziali di come vogliamo che la giustizia penale funzioni nell&#8217;era digitale, di quali garanzie consideriamo irrinunciabili, di come bilanciare esigenze investigative e tutela dei diritti, di come costruire fiducia reciproca tra Stati membri e tra Stati e cittadini. Ridefinire il rapporto tra giustizia penale e spazio digitale nell&#8217;Europa del ventunesimo secolo è la sfida che ci troviamo di fronte. Gli strumenti normativi ci sono, l&#8217;infrastruttura tecnica si sta costruendo. Ora serve la saggezza di usarli bene.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
